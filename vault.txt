The Prusa MK4S is a flagship FDM 3D printer featuring automatic bed leveling, input shaping for faster prints, and a nextruder with quick-swap nozzles. It has a build volume of 250x210x220mm and supports PLA, PETG, ASA, ABS, PC, CPE, PVA, HIPS, PP, Flex, nGen, and composite materials. The MK4S includes a 32-bit control board and runs on Prusa's custom firmware with network connectivity.

The Prusa Mini+ is a compact 3D printer with a 180x180x180mm build volume, perfect for smaller projects and limited workspace. It features a Bowden extruder design, 32-bit electronics, and the same print quality as larger Prusa printers. The Mini+ is ideal for beginners and educational settings like makerspaces.

For PLA filament on the Prusa MK4S, use a nozzle temperature of 210-215°C and bed temperature of 60°C. First layer should be printed at 215°C with bed at 60°C. Print speed can reach 200mm/s with input shaping enabled. Use 0.2mm layer height for standard prints or 0.1mm for detailed models.

PETG settings on Prusa printers require nozzle temperature of 230-250°C and bed temperature of 85°C. PETG is more flexible than PLA and has better heat resistance. Reduce cooling fan to 50% and slow first layer to improve bed adhesion. PETG is hygroscopic and should be stored in dry conditions.

TPU flexible filament requires slower print speeds of 20-40mm/s on the Prusa MK4S. Use direct drive extruder setting, disable retraction or use minimal retraction of 0.5mm. Nozzle temperature should be 220-235°C with bed at 50°C. TPU is excellent for phone cases, gaskets, and flexible mechanical parts.

Common 3D printing issues and solutions: Stringing occurs when temperature is too high or retraction is insufficient - lower temperature by 5°C and increase retraction. Warping happens when bed adhesion fails - clean bed with IPA, use brim, and ensure proper bed temperature. Layer shifting indicates loose belts or motors overheating.

Bed adhesion troubleshooting for Prusa printers: Clean the PEI sheet with 99% isopropyl alcohol before each print. For textured sheets, use dish soap and water monthly. If parts don't stick, increase first layer height, slow first layer speed, or increase bed temperature by 5°C. Live Z adjustment should show slight squish on first layer.

First layer calibration on Prusa MK4S uses the built-in calibration wizard. The nozzle should leave a slightly squished line with no gaps. If the line is too thin or scratchy, raise the Z offset. If the line doesn't stick or has gaps, lower the Z offset. Proper first layer is critical for successful prints.

The Prusa Slicer is the recommended software for preparing 3D models for Prusa printers. It supports STL, 3MF, OBJ, and STEP file formats. Prusa Slicer includes pre-configured profiles for all Prusa printers and materials. Features include variable layer height, support generation, and multi-material printing support.

3MF file format is preferred over STL for 3D printing because it preserves color information, material assignments, and print settings. STL only contains mesh geometry without units or metadata. When exporting from CAD software, choose 3MF when available or STL with units set to millimeters.

Support structures in 3D printing are temporary scaffolding for overhanging parts. Enable supports for overhangs greater than 45 degrees. Organic supports in Prusa Slicer use less material and remove easier. Paint-on supports allow manual control over support placement for complex models.

Infill percentage affects print strength and material usage. Use 15-20% infill for decorative prints, 40-50% for functional parts, and 80-100% for maximum strength. Gyroid infill pattern provides uniform strength in all directions. Grid pattern prints fastest but has directional weakness.

Multi-material printing on Prusa MK4S requires the MMU3 upgrade. This allows printing with up to 5 different filaments in one print. Useful for multi-color prints or combining materials like PLA with soluble PVA supports. MMU3 includes automatic filament loading and unloading.

Laser cutting at the makerspace uses CO2 laser technology capable of cutting and engraving various materials. The laser cutter can process wood, acrylic, leather, paper, cardboard, fabric, and some plastics. Never cut PVC, vinyl, or materials containing chlorine as they release toxic chlorine gas.

Laser cutting safety requires proper ventilation, never leaving the machine unattended during operation, and keeping a fire extinguisher nearby. Always wear appropriate eye protection rated for CO2 lasers. Ensure the exhaust system is running before starting any cut. Know the location of the emergency stop button.

Acrylic laser cutting settings depend on thickness. For 3mm acrylic, use 60-80% power and 15-25mm/s speed. Thicker materials require multiple passes or slower speeds. Cast acrylic produces better edge quality than extruded acrylic. Always remove protective film before laser cutting to prevent fire hazard.

Wood laser cutting works best with plywood, MDF, and solid hardwoods. Avoid cutting treated wood or wood with excessive resin. For 3mm plywood, use 70-90% power at 20-30mm/s. Engrave at lower power (20-40%) and higher speed (100-200mm/s). Wood engraving creates contrast through charring.

Laser cutting design files should be prepared in vector format using software like Adobe Illustrator, Inkscape, or CorelDRAW. Cut lines should be hairline width (0.001mm) in red color. Engrave areas should be filled shapes in black. Export as DXF or SVG format for best compatibility.

Kerf compensation in laser cutting accounts for material removed by the laser beam. Typical kerf is 0.1-0.3mm depending on material and laser settings. For tight-fitting joints, offset your design by half the kerf width. Test kerf on scrap material before cutting final pieces.

Living hinges can be laser cut into wood or acrylic to create flexible joints. Use parallel cuts spaced 1-2mm apart in a grid pattern. Thinner material and tighter spacing creates more flexibility. Living hinges work best in plywood with cross-grain construction.

Raspberry Pi is a series of small single-board computers used for learning programming, electronics projects, and prototyping. The Raspberry Pi 5 features a 2.4GHz quad-core ARM processor, up to 8GB RAM, and supports two 4K displays. It runs Raspberry Pi OS based on Debian Linux.

Arduino Uno specifications include 16MHz clock speed, 32KB flash memory, 2KB SRAM, and 1KB EEPROM. Operating voltage is 5V with recommended input voltage of 7-12V. Each I/O pin can provide 20mA current. The onboard LED is connected to pin 13.

Arduino programming structure requires setup() function for initialization and loop() function for continuous execution. Basic syntax: digitalWrite(pin, HIGH) sets pin high, analogRead(pin) reads analog value 0-1023, delay(ms) pauses execution. Upload code via USB connection.

Blinking LED Arduino code demonstrates basic output control. Connect LED positive leg to pin 13 through 220-ohm resistor, negative to ground. Code: void setup() { pinMode(13, OUTPUT); } void loop() { digitalWrite(13, HIGH); delay(1000); digitalWrite(13, LOW); delay(1000); }

Reading sensors with Arduino uses analog and digital inputs. Temperature sensor LM35 outputs 10mV per degree Celsius - read with analogRead() and convert. Ultrasonic sensor HC-SR04 uses trigger and echo pins for distance measurement. DHT11 sensor provides temperature and humidity readings.

Servo motor control with Arduino uses the Servo library. Connect servo signal wire to PWM pin, red to 5V, black to ground. Code: #include <Servo.h> Servo myServo; void setup() { myServo.attach(9); } void loop() { myServo.write(90); } Servos position from 0 to 180 degrees.

Arduino and Raspberry Pi can communicate via serial USB connection or I2C protocol. Arduino handles real-time sensor reading while Pi processes data and provides network connectivity. Serial communication uses 9600 baud rate typically. This combination is powerful for IoT projects.

3D modeling for printing requires understanding of manifold geometry - models must be watertight with no holes or inverted normals. Wall thickness should be minimum 1.2mm (3 perimeters) for structural parts. Avoid overhangs greater than 45 degrees without supports. Design with print orientation in mind.

Fusion 360 is a professional CAD software free for students and hobbyists. It combines parametric modeling, sculpting, simulation, and CAM in one platform. Export as STL or 3MF for 3D printing. Fusion 360 includes joint simulation for mechanical assemblies and rendering capabilities.

Tinkercad is a browser-based 3D modeling tool perfect for beginners. It uses primitive shapes combined through grouping and boolean operations. Tinkercad integrates directly with 3D printing services and exports STL files. Great for learning basic 3D design concepts without software installation.

Blender is free open-source 3D modeling software used for artistic and organic modeling. While powerful, Blender models often need repair before 3D printing. Use the 3D Print Toolbox addon to check for non-manifold geometry. Blender excels at sculpting and creating complex curved surfaces.

OpenSCAD uses programming code to create 3D models parametrically. Models are defined using geometric primitives and boolean operations in text files. Great for creating customizable designs where dimensions can be easily adjusted. OpenSCAD exports STL directly from code.

STL file repair can be done with Meshmixer, Netfabb, or Windows 3D Builder. Common issues include non-manifold edges, holes in mesh, and inverted normals. Meshmixer's Inspector tool automatically detects and repairs most mesh problems. Always verify models are printable before starting.

Design for 3D printing means considering printer limitations. Add chamfers instead of sharp edges touching the bed. Use mouse ears for small contact areas prone to warping. Design snap-fit tolerances of 0.2-0.4mm depending on printer accuracy. Avoid thin walls under 0.8mm.

The maker movement is a cultural trend emphasizing DIY creation, learning by doing, and sharing knowledge. Makerspaces provide community workshops with tools like 3D printers, laser cutters, CNC machines, and electronics equipment. The movement promotes STEAM education and democratizes manufacturing.

Makerspaces in education foster creativity, problem-solving, and technical skills. Students learn design thinking by iterating through prototype-test-refine cycles. Hands-on projects increase engagement compared to traditional lectures. Makerspaces support interdisciplinary learning combining art, engineering, and computer science.

Høgskolen i Østfold Makerspace provides students access to 3D printing, laser cutting, electronics workstations, and hand tools. The space supports coursework, personal projects, and student organizations. Staff provide training on equipment operation and safety procedures. Booking may be required for certain equipment.

Open-source hardware shares design files freely for anyone to manufacture, modify, and distribute. Arduino, Prusa printers, and many maker tools are open-source. This philosophy accelerates innovation through collaborative development. Makers often share their designs on platforms like Thingiverse, Printables, and GitHub.

Thingiverse and Printables are repositories of free 3D printable designs. Always check license before commercial use - most use Creative Commons licenses. Download STL files and slice with your printer's software. Many designs are remixable, encouraging modification and improvement by the community.

Prototyping workflow in a makerspace typically follows: sketch ideas on paper, create digital 3D model, print prototype, test and evaluate, iterate design. Rapid prototyping allows testing multiple variations quickly. Document your process for future reference and to share knowledge with others.

Safety in the makerspace is everyone's responsibility. Always wear safety glasses when operating power tools or laser cutters. Tie back long hair and avoid loose clothing near rotating equipment. Know emergency stop locations. Never operate equipment without proper training. Report any safety concerns to staff.

Electronics safety includes never working on live circuits, using appropriate voltage levels, and having proper ventilation when soldering. Lead-free solder is preferred in educational settings. Always disconnect power before modifying circuits. Use ESD protection when handling sensitive components like microcontrollers.

I2C communication protocol allows multiple devices to share two wires (SDA and SCL). On Raspberry Pi, enable I2C in raspi-config. Use 'i2cdetect -y 1' to scan for connected devices. Common I2C components include OLED displays, real-time clocks, and sensor modules. Each device has unique address.

SPI protocol is faster than I2C but uses more pins. SPI uses MOSI, MISO, SCK, and CS signals. Arduino SPI library provides transfer() function for communication. SPI devices include SD card modules, TFT displays, and high-speed sensors. Multiple devices share bus with separate chip select pins.

PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) creates analog-like output from digital pins. Arduino analogWrite() outputs 0-255 values on PWM pins (marked with ~). PWM controls LED brightness, motor speed, and servo position. 8-bit PWM divides signal into 256 levels. Higher frequency PWM reduces flicker in LEDs.

Motor control with Arduino requires motor driver like L298N or L293D. Direct GPIO connection can damage the microcontroller. H-bridge drivers allow bidirectional motor control. PWM input controls motor speed while direction pins control rotation direction. Always include flyback diodes for inductive loads.

Stepper motors provide precise position control without feedback. Common types are NEMA 17 used in 3D printers. Driver boards like A4988 or TMC2209 translate step and direction signals. Microstepping increases resolution but reduces torque. Full step mode provides maximum torque for high-load applications.

NeoPixel addressable LEDs (WS2812B) create colorful lighting effects with single data wire. Each LED contains integrated controller chip. Arduino NeoPixel library simplifies programming. Chain multiple LEDs together - data out connects to next data in. Power directly from 5V supply for long strips.

OLED displays provide crisp text and graphics output for projects. Common sizes are 0.96" and 1.3" with I2C interface. Adafruit SSD1306 library works with most OLED modules. Display text with display.println() and graphics with drawing functions. OLED pixels are self-emitting, providing high contrast.

Temperature sensing with DS18B20 uses Dallas OneWire protocol. Sensor provides digital temperature reading with 0.5°C accuracy. Multiple sensors can share single data pin using unique addresses. Waterproof versions available for liquid temperature measurement. 4.7K pullup resistor required on data line.

PIR motion sensors detect infrared radiation changes from moving people. Digital output goes HIGH when motion detected. Sensitivity and timing adjustable with potentiometers. Common in security projects and automatic lighting. HC-SR501 module operates from 5V with 3.3V compatible output.

Ultrasonic distance sensor HC-SR04 measures distance using sound waves. Trigger pin sends pulse, echo pin receives reflection. Calculate distance: distance = (pulse_time * 343) / 2 in meters. Range is 2cm to 400cm with 3mm accuracy. Use pulseIn() function in Arduino to measure echo time.

Photoresistor (LDR) changes resistance based on light intensity. Create voltage divider with fixed resistor and read with analogRead(). Higher light means lower resistance. Use for automatic night lights, light-following robots, or ambient light sensing. Values range from ~1K ohm (bright) to ~10K ohm (dark).

Relay modules switch high-voltage devices with microcontroller signals. Use 5V relay modules with Arduino, optoisolated preferred for safety. Never exceed relay current rating. Relays allow controlling AC mains devices - always use extreme caution with mains voltage. Consider solid-state relays for silent operation.

LCD character displays like 16x2 or 20x4 show text output. HD44780 compatible displays use LiquidCrystal library. I2C adapter reduces wiring to just 4 wires. lcd.print() outputs text, lcd.setCursor() positions cursor. Useful for displaying sensor readings, menus, and status information.

MicroPython runs Python directly on microcontrollers like ESP32 and Raspberry Pi Pico. Syntax is nearly identical to standard Python. Interactive REPL allows testing code line by line. MicroPython includes machine library for GPIO, PWM, I2C, and SPI. Great for rapid prototyping without compilation.

ESP32 microcontroller includes built-in WiFi and Bluetooth. Program with Arduino IDE or MicroPython. Dual-core processor runs at 240MHz with 520KB SRAM. Perfect for IoT projects requiring wireless connectivity. ESP32 can create web servers, connect to MQTT brokers, and communicate with cloud services.

Soldering technique for electronics requires clean tip, proper temperature (300-350°C for lead-free), and quality solder. Heat both pad and component lead, apply solder to joint not iron. Good joint appears shiny and concave. Cold joints look dull and grainy - reheat and add flux if needed.

Breadboard prototyping allows circuit building without soldering. Rows are connected horizontally, power rails run vertically. Use jumper wires to make connections. Test circuits on breadboard before committing to permanent PCB. Color-code wires: red for power, black for ground.

PCB design software like KiCad is free and open-source. Design workflow: create schematic, assign footprints, layout board, generate gerber files. Send gerbers to PCB manufacturer like JLCPCB or PCBWay. Minimum trace width typically 0.2mm, via size 0.3mm for standard boards.

Oscilloscope basics help debug electronic circuits. Oscilloscope displays voltage over time. Set voltage scale (volts/div) and time scale (seconds/div) to see signal clearly. Trigger stabilizes repetitive waveforms. Use probes properly - connect ground clip near measurement point.

Multimeter measures voltage, current, and resistance. Always start with highest range to avoid damage. Measure voltage in parallel with circuit, current in series. Continuity mode beeps when circuit is complete. Check batteries, trace connections, and verify component values.

Power supply considerations for projects include voltage, current capacity, and regulation. USB provides 5V at 500mA-3A depending on source. Arduino Vin accepts 7-12V. Use voltage regulators (7805, LM1117) to create stable voltages. Calculate total current draw and add 20% safety margin.

Decoupling capacitors reduce noise in digital circuits. Place 0.1µF ceramic capacitor between VCC and GND near each IC. Larger electrolytic capacitors (10-100µF) filter power supply ripple. Proper decoupling prevents erratic behavior and interference between components.

Git version control tracks changes in code and design files. Basic commands: git init, git add, git commit, git push. GitHub provides free repository hosting. Commit frequently with descriptive messages. Use branches for experimental features. Version control essential for collaborative projects.

Documentation practices make projects reproducible. Include bill of materials, wiring diagrams, and code comments. Photograph build progress. Write setup instructions assuming reader has no prior knowledge. Good documentation helps future-you and others learning from your work.

Project enclosure design should consider ventilation, access to ports, and mounting holes. Add 0.3-0.5mm tolerance for 3D printed enclosures. Include cable strain relief. Design snap-fit or screw bosses for assembly. Consider using heat-set inserts for threaded holes in plastic.

Debugging strategies when things don't work: simplify to minimum working example, check power supply voltage, verify connections with multimeter, add serial print statements to code, check for common mistakes (wrong pin, missing library, typo in code). Systematic elimination finds problems faster than random changes.

File organization for maker projects: create dedicated folder structure with subfolders for CAD, code, documentation, and images. Use descriptive file names with version numbers. Back up important files to cloud storage. Share projects on GitHub with README explaining purpose and usage.

Iterative design process improves projects through cycles of build-test-learn. First prototype tests basic concept, subsequent versions refine details. Document what works and what doesn't. Failure is valuable learning - analyze why something failed before next attempt. Share lessons learned with community.

Laser engraving creates images by varying power and speed to produce different shades. Convert photos to grayscale and apply dithering for best results. Test settings on scrap material. Different materials engrave with different contrast levels. Wood and leather produce excellent engraving results.

Vector vs raster in laser cutting: vector mode follows paths for cutting and line engraving, raster mode scans back and forth for filled engraving. Use vector for outlines and text paths, raster for images and filled areas. Combine both in single job by using different colors.

Finger joint boxes in laser cutting create strong interlocking assemblies. Use online generators like MakerCase or BoxMaker to create designs. Account for material thickness and kerf. Test fit with prototype before cutting final material. Glue joints for permanent assembly or design for friction fit.

Prusa Mini with Input Shaper requires firmware 5.1.0 or newer and Input Shaper profiles in PrusaSlicer. To enable Input Shaper, go to Configuration > Configuration Wizard and select the Input Shaper profile for your printer. Input Shaper reduces ghosting and ringing by canceling resonance vibrations, enabling faster print speeds.

Input Shaper on Prusa Mini works best when belts are properly tensioned and extruder tension is adjusted correctly. Before using Input Shaper, perform basic maintenance: check belt tension on X and Y axes, ensure nozzle is clean, and verify no debris on smooth rods. Loose belts cause poor Input Shaper performance.

Prusa Mini Input Shaper profiles include Structural and Speed settings for each layer height. Structural settings focus on quality, precision, and structural integrity while maintaining faster speeds than non-IS printing. Speed settings prioritize time savings with some quality compromise.

For PLA with Input Shaper on Prusa Mini, you may need to increase temperature by 5-10°C to ensure proper melting at higher speeds. PETG with Input Shaper typically requires 10°C higher temperature than standard profiles. If experiencing under-extrusion, increase temperature gradually.

Seam issues with Input Shaper on Prusa Mini can be controlled by adjusting retraction settings. Stock PETG profile uses 0.8mm retraction which works for most prints. For prints with small blobs at stops, reduce retraction to 0.2-0.4mm for better results.

Input Shaper calibration on Prusa MK4S uses firmware-based automatic calibration. The printer measures its own resonance frequencies and applies compensation. For custom tuning, M593 X F[frequency] and M593 Y F[frequency] commands set specific frequencies. Default MK4S frequencies are optimized for stock configuration.

Prusa MK4S with Input Shaper prints Benchy in approximately 16-20 minutes compared to over 1 hour without IS. The combination of faster acceleration, higher travel speeds, and Pressure Advance compensation enables these speed improvements while maintaining quality.

Print quality troubleshooting with Input Shaper: If surfaces appear bumpy or layers shifted, check belt tension first. Tighten both X and Y belts if needed. If print quality issues persist, verify extruder tension is adequate. Loose extruder gear causes under-extrusion at high speeds.

Raspberry Pi 5 features the Broadcom BCM2712 quad-core ARM Cortex-A76 processor running at 2.4GHz, making it 2-3 times faster than Raspberry Pi 4. Available in 2GB, 4GB, 8GB, and 16GB RAM variants. Supports two 4K displays at 60Hz via dual micro-HDMI ports.

Raspberry Pi 5 GPIO uses the new RP1 I/O controller chip with 28 multi-functional GPIO pins on the standard 40-pin header. GPIO pins tolerate up to 5V when powered and 3.63V when unpowered. The GPIO bank operates at 3.3V logic levels.

Raspberry Pi 5 GPIO features include 5 UART interfaces, 6 SPI buses, 4 I2C interfaces, 2 I2S for audio, 4-channel PWM output, and general-purpose clock pins. This is more peripheral options than previous Pi models, enabling more complex projects.

Important: The RPi.GPIO library does not work on Raspberry Pi 5 due to the new RP1 chip. Use GPIO Zero (recommended for beginners) or gpiod library instead. GPIO Zero is pre-installed and automatically uses the compatible lgpio backend on Pi 5.

Raspberry Pi 5 new features include a built-in real-time clock (RTC) with battery backup connector, dedicated power button for safe shutdown, and PCIe 2.0 connector for NVMe SSD support. The power button performs safe shutdown with single press and power on from standby.

Raspberry Pi 5 requires a 5V 5A (27W) USB-C power supply for full performance. Using an underpowered supply may cause throttling or instability. The official Raspberry Pi 27W power supply is recommended. Active cooling is also recommended for sustained workloads.

Raspberry Pi 4 Model B specifications: Broadcom BCM2711 quad-core Cortex-A72 at 1.8GHz, up to 8GB RAM, dual 4K micro-HDMI, USB 3.0 ports, Gigabit Ethernet, dual-band WiFi, Bluetooth 5.0. GPIO remains 40-pin compatible with previous models.

Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+ features quad-core Cortex-A53 at 1.4GHz, 1GB RAM, 802.11ac WiFi, Bluetooth 4.2, Gigabit Ethernet over USB 2.0, and 40-pin GPIO. Good for learning projects and lighter applications where Pi 4/5 power is unnecessary.

Raspberry Pi 2 Model B uses quad-core Cortex-A7 at 900MHz with 1GB RAM. No built-in WiFi or Bluetooth - requires USB dongles for wireless connectivity. Still useful for headless servers, basic GPIO projects, and learning purposes.

Raspberry Pi 1 Model B+ was the original Pi with single-core ARM1176JZF-S at 700MHz and 512MB RAM. Historic significance as the device that started the Pi revolution. Limited modern application but still educational for understanding computing basics.

Raspberry Pi Pico is a microcontroller board based on the RP2040 chip with dual-core ARM Cortex-M0+ at 133MHz, 264KB SRAM, and 2MB flash storage. It has 26 GPIO pins, 3 analog inputs, and supports MicroPython and C/C++ programming. Cost is approximately $4.

Raspberry Pi Pico W adds wireless connectivity with 2.4GHz 802.11n WiFi and Bluetooth 5.2. Same RP2040 processor as standard Pico. Perfect for IoT projects requiring wireless communication. Program with MicroPython or C/C++ using the Pico SDK.

Programming Raspberry Pi Pico with MicroPython: Hold BOOTSEL button while connecting USB, drag MicroPython UF2 file to RPI-RP2 drive, then use Thonny IDE to write and run Python code. The Pico reboots into MicroPython mode automatically.

Pico GPIO in MicroPython uses the machine module. Basic LED control: from machine import Pin; led = Pin(25, Pin.OUT); led.on() turns on the onboard LED. For external LED: led = Pin(16, Pin.OUT); led.value(1) sets GPIO 16 high.

Pico button input with MicroPython: from machine import Pin; button = Pin(14, Pin.IN, Pin.PULL_DOWN) configures GPIO 14 as input with internal pull-down resistor. Read state with button.value() which returns 0 or 1.

Pico analog input uses ADC class: from machine import ADC; pot = ADC(26) reads analog values on GPIO 26. The 12-bit ADC returns values 0-65535 (scaled to 16-bit). Convert to voltage: volts = pot.read_u16() * 3.3 / 65535.

Pico PWM for LED dimming or servo control: from machine import PWM; pwm = PWM(Pin(16)); pwm.freq(1000); pwm.duty_u16(32768) sets 50% duty cycle at 1kHz. Duty range is 0-65535.

Pico I2C communication: from machine import I2C; i2c = I2C(0, scl=Pin(17), sda=Pin(16), freq=400000) initializes I2C bus 0. Scan for devices with i2c.scan() which returns list of addresses.

Resistors limit current flow in circuits. Measured in Ohms. Use Ohm's Law: V = I × R. For LED protection, calculate: R = (Vsupply - Vled) / I. Example: 5V supply, 2V red LED, 20mA current needs (5-2)/0.02 = 150 ohm resistor.

Resistor color codes: Black=0, Brown=1, Red=2, Orange=3, Yellow=4, Green=5, Blue=6, Violet=7, Gray=8, White=9. First two bands are digits, third is multiplier, fourth is tolerance. Example: Brown-Black-Red = 10 × 100 = 1000 ohms (1K).

Capacitors store electrical charge and release it when needed. Measured in Farads (F), typically microfarads (µF) or picofarads (pF). Electrolytic capacitors are polarized - connect positive leg to higher voltage. Ceramic capacitors are non-polarized.

Capacitor applications: Decoupling capacitors (0.1µF ceramic) filter noise near ICs. Bulk capacitors (10-100µF electrolytic) smooth power supply ripple. Timing circuits use RC time constant: τ = R × C seconds.

LEDs (Light Emitting Diodes) emit light when current flows through them. Different colors have different forward voltages: Red ~2V, Yellow ~2.1V, Green ~2.2V, Blue/White ~3.2V. Always use current-limiting resistor to prevent LED damage.

LED polarity: longer leg is anode (positive), shorter leg is cathode (negative). Flat spot on LED body indicates cathode. Current flows from anode to cathode. Typical LED current is 10-20mA.

Diodes allow current to flow in one direction only. Forward voltage drop is typically 0.6-0.7V for silicon diodes. Use for reverse polarity protection, rectification, and signal clamping. 1N4001 is common general-purpose diode rated 1A.

Transistors act as switches or amplifiers. NPN transistors (like 2N2222, BC547): current flows collector to emitter when base receives small current. Connect base through 1K-10K resistor to control signal. Collector connects to load.

Transistor as switch: When base voltage exceeds ~0.7V, transistor turns on, allowing current through collector-emitter. Can switch loads much larger than microcontroller can directly drive. Essential for motor control and relay driving.

MOSFET transistors are voltage-controlled switches. N-channel MOSFETs (like IRLZ44N) turn on when gate voltage exceeds threshold (~2-4V). Very low on-resistance allows high current switching with minimal heat. Logic-level MOSFETs work with 3.3V/5V logic.

Potentiometers are variable resistors with three terminals. Middle terminal (wiper) provides variable voltage when connected as voltage divider. Use for analog input, volume control, or calibration adjustments. Available in linear and logarithmic tapers.

Push buttons are momentary switches that connect when pressed. Use with pull-up or pull-down resistor for clean digital input. Internal pull-up resistors in microcontrollers simplify wiring. Debounce in software or with capacitor for reliable reading.

Voltage regulators convert higher voltage to stable lower voltage. 7805 provides 5V output from 7-35V input. LM1117-3.3 provides 3.3V from 5V input. Include input and output capacitors (0.1µF and 10µF) for stable operation.

Glowforge is a desktop CO2 laser cutter and engraver with cloud-based software. Models include Glowforge Basic (40W), Glowforge Plus (40W faster), and Glowforge Pro (45W with passthrough slot). Cutting area is 12" × 20" for Basic/Plus, unlimited length with Pro passthrough.

Glowforge Proofgrade materials have QR codes that automatically set correct cut/engrave settings. Materials include plywood, hardwood, acrylic, leather, and more. For non-Proofgrade materials, you must manually enter settings for speed, power, and focus height.

Glowforge safe materials: wood (plywood, MDF, hardwood), acrylic, leather, paper, cardboard, fabric (cotton, felt), cork, rubber stamps, and anodized aluminum for engraving. Always verify material is laser-safe before cutting.

NEVER cut PVC, vinyl, or chlorine-containing plastics in Glowforge - they release toxic chlorine gas that damages the machine and is dangerous to breathe. Polycarbonate (Lexan) also should not be cut as it melts and produces toxic fumes.

Glowforge acrylic settings for 1/8" (3mm): Cut at Speed 180, Full Power. For 1/4" (6mm): Cut at Speed 110, Full Power. Engrave at Speed 1000, Full Power, 270 LPI. Cast acrylic produces better edge quality than extruded acrylic.

Glowforge wood settings vary by type and thickness. For 1/8" plywood: Cut around Speed 180-200, Power 100%. Engrave at Speed 1000, Power varies (40-80% depending on desired darkness). Always test on scrap material first.

Glowforge manual mode parameters: Speed controls laser head movement (faster = shallower cut). Power controls laser intensity (Full Power for cutting, Precision Power for consistent engraving). LPI (Lines Per Inch) controls engrave resolution - higher LPI = smoother but slower.

Glowforge focus height must match material thickness for optimal cutting. Auto-focus measures material automatically for Proofgrade. For manual materials, measure thickness accurately and enter in settings. Incorrect focus causes poor cuts and burns.

Glowforge Cut vs Score vs Engrave: Cut goes all the way through material. Score is lower-power cut that marks surface without cutting through - good for fold lines. Engrave fills areas by rastering back and forth - used for images and filled shapes.

Glowforge safety: Never leave machine unattended during operation. Ensure exhaust is running before starting. Keep fire extinguisher nearby. Small flames at cut point are normal, but lasting flames require emergency stop. Never cut unknown materials.

Glowforge file formats: SVG (preferred for cut lines), PDF, PNG, JPG for engraving. Cut lines should be hairline stroke width. Different colors in design become separate steps you can assign different settings. Use 96 DPI for raster images.

Gyroid infill pattern provides near-isotropic strength, meaning roughly equal strength in all directions. It uses a continuous curved surface that spirals throughout the part. Excellent for shear resistance and functional parts requiring multi-directional strength.

Gyroid infill is approximately 30% lighter than honeycomb while providing similar or better strength. MIT research showed gyroid structures achieve exceptional strength-to-weight ratios. Best used at 15-25% density for functional parts.

Honeycomb infill pattern offers excellent strength-to-weight ratio, particularly good for compression loads. Studies show honeycomb has highest peak compressive strength among common patterns. Good for parts that need to resist crushing forces.

Triangle infill is one of the strongest patterns, especially for perpendicular forces (top-down compression). Triangles resist deformation better than other shapes - same principle used in roof trusses and bridges. Use for maximum vertical strength.

Cubic infill creates 3D grid of cubes for good all-direction strength. Less prone to printer vibration than honeycomb pattern. Adaptive cubic variant adjusts density based on distance from walls, saving material in interior while maintaining strength near surfaces.

Grid/rectilinear infill is fastest to print and very strong in the alignment direction but weak perpendicular to lines. Good for parts where force direction is known. Each layer alternates 90° creating cross-hatch pattern.

Infill percentage guidelines: 10-15% for decorative/display items, 15-25% for general purpose parts, 25-50% for functional parts with moderate loads, 50-80% for high-strength structural parts. Doubling infill does not double strength - diminishing returns above 50%.

Wall/perimeter count affects strength more than infill percentage. Increase wall count from 2 to 4 for significantly stronger parts using less material than increasing infill. Most strength comes from outer walls, not internal infill structure.

Infill overlap percentage controls how much infill overlaps with perimeter walls. Default 25-30% works for most prints. Increase to 40-50% if infill separates from walls. Too high overlap can cause over-extrusion artifacts at wall-infill junction.

Best practices for high-quality 3D prints start with proper first layer adhesion. Clean build plate with IPA before each print. Ensure correct Live Z calibration - first layer should be slightly squished without being too thin. Bed temperature appropriate for material.

PLA best print settings: Nozzle 200-215°C, bed 55-60°C, cooling fan 100% after first layer. PLA is easiest material to print with low warping tendency. Good for prototypes, decorative items, and parts not exposed to heat above 50°C.

PETG best print settings: Nozzle 230-250°C, bed 75-90°C, cooling fan 50%. PETG is stronger and more heat-resistant than PLA. Slightly stringy - increase retraction or use wipe settings. Good for functional parts, outdoor use, and food-safe applications.

ABS best print settings: Nozzle 230-250°C, bed 95-110°C, enclosure required to prevent warping. ABS is strong and heat-resistant but releases fumes - ensure ventilation. Good for parts needing heat resistance, impact strength, or acetone smoothing.

TPU flexible filament settings: Nozzle 220-235°C, bed 40-60°C, print speed 20-30mm/s maximum. Direct drive extruder required for reliable printing. Disable or minimize retraction (0-1mm). Good for phone cases, gaskets, grips, and shock absorption.

Layer height selection: 0.1mm for fine detail and smooth surfaces, 0.2mm for standard quality/speed balance, 0.3mm for fast prototypes. Layer height should not exceed 80% of nozzle diameter for proper adhesion.

Nozzle size affects detail and speed: 0.4mm standard for most prints, 0.25mm for fine detail but slower, 0.6-0.8mm for faster prints and stronger layer bonding. Larger nozzles require thicker minimum walls.

Print orientation matters for strength: parts are weakest between layers (Z direction). Orient parts so primary stress is along layer lines, not across them. Use supports when needed but minimize for cleaner surfaces.

Support settings optimization: Use supports only where truly needed - overhangs above 45-60° typically. Organic/tree supports often easier to remove than grid supports. Increase support Z distance (0.2-0.3mm) for easier removal.

Brim vs skirt vs raft: Skirt purges nozzle and shows bed level issues. Brim adds thin layer around part base for adhesion on parts with small footprint. Raft creates full base under part - use only if adhesion problems persist.

Retraction settings prevent stringing: Start with 1mm retraction at 25mm/s for direct drive, 4-6mm at 45mm/s for Bowden. Increase retraction if stringing occurs, decrease if gaps appear at layer starts.

Print speed optimization: External perimeters 25-40mm/s for quality, internal perimeters 40-60mm/s, infill 60-80mm/s or higher. Slow first layer to 20-25mm/s for adhesion. With Input Shaper, speeds can increase 2-3x.

Temperature tuning: Print temperature tower to find optimal temp for each filament. Too hot causes stringing and blob, too cold causes poor layer adhesion and weak prints. Different colors of same brand may need different temps.

Cooling optimization: PLA needs maximum cooling after first layer. PETG needs moderate cooling (40-60%). ABS and other high-temp materials need minimal or no part cooling. Bridge areas benefit from extra cooling.

Preventing warping: Use heated bed at correct temperature, use brim for large parts, ensure enclosure for ABS, avoid drafts during printing, use proper first layer settings. Large flat prints are most prone to warping.

Dealing with elephants foot (first layer bulge): Decrease first layer flow or increase first layer Z height slightly. Also called first layer compensation - some slicers have specific setting for this. Affects dimensional accuracy of bottom.

Z seam placement: Hide seam in corners using "sharpest corner" setting or align seams in a line with "aligned" setting. Random seam distributes artifacts but creates scattered bumps. Coasting and wipe settings reduce seam visibility.

Moisture in filament causes popping, stringing, and poor surface quality. Store filament in dry boxes with desiccant. Dry wet filament in food dehydrator or dedicated filament dryer at 50°C for PLA, 65°C for PETG, for 4-6 hours.

Dimensional accuracy troubleshooting: If holes too small, enable hole horizontal expansion. If overall dimensions off, calibrate E-steps and flow rate. Elephant foot affects bottom dimensions. Different materials shrink differently during cooling.

Post-processing techniques: Sanding (start 200 grit, progress to higher), painting (prime first for best results), acetone vapor smoothing for ABS, epoxy coating for smooth finish, heat gun for careful surface improvement on some materials.

Arduino Uno specifications: ATmega328P microcontroller, 16MHz clock, 14 digital I/O pins (6 PWM), 6 analog inputs, 32KB flash, 2KB SRAM, 1KB EEPROM. Operating voltage 5V, input voltage 7-12V recommended. USB Type-B connection for programming.

Arduino Nano is smaller version of Uno with same ATmega328P chip. Mini-B USB connector, breadboard-friendly form factor. Same 14 digital pins and 6 analog inputs. Good for compact projects where Uno is too large.

Arduino Mega 2560 for larger projects: ATmega2560 with 54 digital I/O pins (15 PWM), 16 analog inputs, 256KB flash, 8KB SRAM. Four hardware serial ports. Use when Uno doesn't have enough pins or memory for your project.

Arduino programming structure: setup() runs once at power-on for initialization. loop() runs continuously after setup. Basic functions: pinMode(pin, OUTPUT/INPUT), digitalWrite(pin, HIGH/LOW), digitalRead(pin), analogRead(pin), analogWrite(pin, 0-255).

Arduino digital output for LED: pinMode(13, OUTPUT); in setup, then digitalWrite(13, HIGH); to turn on, digitalWrite(13, LOW); to turn off. Built-in LED is on pin 13 on most Arduino boards.

Arduino digital input for button: pinMode(2, INPUT_PULLUP); enables internal pull-up resistor. Button connects pin to GND. digitalRead(2) returns LOW when pressed, HIGH when released. INPUT_PULLUP simplifies wiring.

Arduino analog input reads 0-5V as 0-1023 values. int sensorValue = analogRead(A0); reads analog pin A0. Convert to voltage: float voltage = sensorValue * (5.0 / 1023.0); Resolution is approximately 4.9mV per step.

Arduino PWM output for dimming: analogWrite(pin, 0-255); on PWM-capable pins (marked with ~). 0 is always off, 255 is always on, 127 is 50% duty cycle. Use for LED dimming, motor speed control, servo positioning.

Arduino Serial communication: Serial.begin(9600); in setup initializes at 9600 baud. Serial.println("Hello"); sends text to computer. Serial.available() checks for incoming data. Serial.read() reads one byte.

Arduino delay() pauses program: delay(1000); waits 1000 milliseconds (1 second). For non-blocking timing, use millis() function: if (millis() - lastTime >= interval) allows other code to run while waiting.

Arduino Servo library controls hobby servos: #include <Servo.h>, Servo myServo;, myServo.attach(9);, myServo.write(90); positions servo at 90 degrees. Valid range typically 0-180 degrees.

Arduino I2C with Wire library: Wire.begin(); initializes as master. Wire.beginTransmission(address); starts communication. Wire.write(data); sends bytes. Wire.endTransmission(); completes transmission. Wire.requestFrom(address, bytes); reads from device.

Arduino SPI for fast communication: #include <SPI.h>, SPI.begin();, SPI.transfer(data); sends and receives simultaneously. Use digitalWrite() to control chip select (CS) pin for each device. Faster than I2C for high-speed data.

Arduino interrupt for instant response: attachInterrupt(digitalPinToInterrupt(2), myFunction, RISING); calls myFunction when pin 2 goes from LOW to HIGH. Use for encoders, buttons requiring instant response, or external events.

Arduino motor control with L298N driver: Connect IN1, IN2 to digital pins for direction, ENA to PWM pin for speed. digitalWrite(IN1, HIGH); digitalWrite(IN2, LOW); sets direction. analogWrite(ENA, speed); controls speed 0-255.

Arduino HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor: Trigger pin sends 10µs pulse, Echo pin receives reflection. Distance = (pulse duration × 0.034) / 2 cm. Use pulseIn(echoPin, HIGH); to measure pulse duration. Range 2-400cm.

Arduino DHT11/DHT22 temperature and humidity sensor: Use DHT library. DHT dht(pin, DHT11);, dht.begin();, float temp = dht.readTemperature();, float humidity = dht.readHumidity();. DHT22 more accurate than DHT11.

Arduino OLED display with SSD1306: Use Adafruit_SSD1306 library. display.begin(SSD1306_SWITCHCAPVCC, 0x3C); for I2C address 0x3C. display.clearDisplay();, display.setCursor(0,0);, display.println("Hello");, display.display(); to show text.

Arduino NeoPixel LED strips: Use Adafruit_NeoPixel library. Adafruit_NeoPixel strip(NUM_LEDS, PIN, NEO_GRB + NEO_KHZ800);, strip.begin();, strip.setPixelColor(n, red, green, blue);, strip.show(); updates LEDs.

Arduino SD card logging: #include <SD.h>, SD.begin(CS_PIN);, File dataFile = SD.open("log.txt", FILE_WRITE);, dataFile.println(data);, dataFile.close();. Use for data logging projects. FAT16/FAT32 formatted cards supported.

CNC (Computer Numerical Control) machines use computer-controlled motors to move cutting tools along precise paths. CNC routers cut softer materials like wood, plastic, and aluminum. CNC mills handle harder metals with greater precision. Both use G-code instructions to control movement.

CNC axis terminology: X-axis is left-right movement, Y-axis is front-back movement, Z-axis is up-down movement. Home position is the machine's reference point (usually front-left corner at maximum Z height). Work zero is the origin point you set on your material.

CNC spindle holds and rotates the cutting tool. Spindle speed measured in RPM (rotations per minute). Higher RPM for smaller tools and softer materials, lower RPM for larger tools and harder materials. Variable speed spindles allow optimization for different operations.

Feed rate is how fast the tool moves through material, measured in mm/min or inches/min. Too fast causes tool breakage and poor finish. Too slow causes burning in wood and excessive tool wear. Optimal feed rate depends on material, tool size, and depth of cut.

Depth of cut (DOC) is how deep the tool cuts per pass. Shallow passes (1-3mm) are safer and produce better finish. Deep passes remove material faster but stress the tool and machine. Step-down is the Z-axis depth increment between passes.

Stepover (or width of cut) is how much the tool moves sideways between passes in pocket operations. Typically 40-60% of tool diameter for roughing, 10-20% for finishing. Smaller stepover gives smoother surface but takes longer.

G-code is the programming language for CNC machines. G0 is rapid move (fastest, not cutting). G1 is linear cutting move at specified feed rate. G2/G3 are clockwise/counterclockwise arc moves. M codes control machine functions like spindle on/off.

Essential G-code commands: G28 homes all axes, G90 sets absolute positioning, G91 sets relative positioning, G20/G21 sets inches/millimeters, M3 starts spindle clockwise, M5 stops spindle, M30 ends program.

Example G-code program structure: Start with setup (units, positioning mode), then spindle start, move to start position, cutting operations, return to safe position, spindle stop, program end. Always include safe Z moves between operations.

CNC workholding secures material during cutting. Clamps hold material to spoilboard but create obstacles for tool paths. Double-sided tape works for flat pieces but may slip under heavy cuts. Vacuum tables provide unobstructed surface for sheet goods.

T-slot tables use bolts in slots to secure clamps anywhere on the bed. Toe clamps press down on material edges. Step clamps hold material from the side. Always ensure clamps are below the cutting plane to avoid collisions.

Spoilboard is sacrificial surface that protects the machine bed. MDF is common spoilboard material. Surface the spoilboard flat periodically. Cut slightly into spoilboard when through-cutting parts to ensure complete separation.

End mills are the primary CNC cutting tools. Flat end mills create square corners and flat bottoms. Ball end mills create rounded surfaces and 3D contours. Number of flutes affects chip evacuation - fewer flutes for soft materials, more for metals.

Upcut end mills pull chips up and out of the cut, good for chip clearance but may cause tearout on top surface. Downcut end mills push chips down, giving clean top edge but may pack chips in deep cuts. Compression bits combine both for clean edges on both surfaces.

V-bits create angled cuts for chamfers, engraving, and V-carving. Common angles are 60° and 90°. V-carve operations vary depth based on design width - wider areas cut deeper. Great for signs and decorative text.

Speeds and feeds for wood: Softwood (pine) uses higher feed rates than hardwood (oak). Start conservative and increase. Typical starting point for 6mm end mill in wood: 18000 RPM, 2000mm/min feed, 3mm depth of cut.

Speeds and feeds for aluminum: Much slower than wood. Use single-flute end mills for better chip evacuation. Cutting fluid or mist cooling recommended. Starting point for 6mm end mill: 10000 RPM, 500mm/min feed, 0.5mm depth of cut.

Speeds and feeds for acrylic: Medium settings between wood and metal. Use upcut or O-flute bits to prevent melting. Avoid dwelling in one spot. Starting point: 18000 RPM, 1500mm/min feed, 2mm depth of cut.

CAM (Computer-Aided Manufacturing) software converts 3D models into G-code toolpaths. Fusion 360 includes integrated CAM with many toolpath strategies. Free for hobbyists and education. Handles complex 3D machining operations.

Fusion 360 CAM workflow: Import or design part, enter Manufacturing workspace, create Setup (define stock and work coordinate system), create toolpaths for each operation, simulate to verify, post-process to generate G-code for your machine.

Carbide Create is free CAM software from Carbide 3D. Simpler than Fusion 360, focused on 2D and 2.5D operations. Good for signs, simple parts, and beginners. Includes material and tool library with recommended settings.

CAM toolpath types: Profile/contour cuts along the outline of a shape. Pocket removes material from an enclosed area. Drill creates holes. Engrave follows lines at constant depth. Adaptive/trochoidal clears large areas efficiently with constant tool engagement.

Tabs in CAM hold parts to stock material during cutting. Without tabs, parts may shift when cut free, causing damage. Place tabs on straight edges where possible. Remove tabs with hand tools after cutting and sand smooth.

Vinyl cutters use a small blade to cut shapes from vinyl sheets. The blade moves along X-axis while material moves along Y-axis. Blade pressure and speed are adjustable for different materials. Common brands include Cricut, Silhouette, and Roland.

Vinyl cutter blade depth is critical - blade should cut through vinyl but not the backing paper. Test cut before starting project. Replace blade when cuts become ragged or require excessive pressure. Different blade types for different materials.

Adhesive vinyl (permanent and removable) sticks directly to surfaces. Permanent vinyl for outdoor use, dishwasher-safe items. Removable vinyl for temporary applications, wall decals, stencils. Clean surface with alcohol before application.

HTV (Heat Transfer Vinyl) is applied to fabric using heat press or iron. Mirror/flip designs before cutting since vinyl is applied face-down. Different HTV types: standard, stretch for athletic wear, glitter, flock (fuzzy texture).

HTV application temperature typically 305-320°F (150-160°C) for 10-15 seconds with medium pressure. Peel carrier sheet warm or cold depending on vinyl type. Wait 24 hours before washing garments. Inside-out, gentle cycle recommended.

Weeding is removing excess vinyl from around your cut design. Use weeding hook or dental pick tool. Good lighting and magnification help with small details. Weed on a light-colored surface to see what you're removing.

Transfer tape moves cut vinyl designs from backing to final surface. Clear transfer tape lets you see positioning. Paper transfer tape is less expensive for simple designs. Apply firmly, burnish well, then peel at 45° angle.

Wet application method for large vinyl graphics: Spray surface with soapy water, position vinyl, squeegee out water and air bubbles from center outward. Allows repositioning before water dries. Essential for vehicle graphics.

Vinyl design preparation: Convert text to outlines/paths. Ensure all shapes are closed paths. Remove overlapping areas (weld/unite shapes). Add registration marks for multi-color designs. Check blade offset for sharp corners.

Registration marks align multiple vinyl colors or layers. Cut small marks (crosses or circles) on each color layer in same position. Apply first layer, align subsequent layers using marks. Remove registration marks from final design.

Resin 3D printing (SLA/MSLA) uses UV light to cure liquid photopolymer resin layer by layer. SLA uses laser to trace each layer. MSLA (masked) uses LCD screen to expose entire layer at once. Higher detail than FDM but requires more post-processing.

Resin printer components: Vat/tank holds liquid resin with FEP film bottom. Build plate moves up as layers cure. UV light source (laser or LCD) cures resin through FEP. Z-axis precision determines layer quality.

Standard resin is general-purpose, relatively brittle. Tough/ABS-like resin has better impact resistance. Flexible resin for bendable parts. Water-washable resin simplifies cleaning but may be weaker. Castable resin burns out cleanly for jewelry casting.

Resin exposure settings: Layer height typically 0.025-0.05mm (finer than FDM). Bottom layers need longer exposure (30-60 seconds) for bed adhesion. Normal layers much shorter (2-8 seconds depending on resin and printer).

Resin support placement is critical for success. Parts print upside-down hanging from build plate. Angle parts to reduce cross-sectional area and peel forces. Support islands (disconnected areas) will fall into vat. Auto-supports often need manual adjustment.

Resin supports should have small contact points (0.3-0.5mm) for easy removal. Dense supports on initial layers, lighter supports higher up. Support critical features like thin walls and overhangs. Check support preview before printing.

Resin post-processing step 1: Washing removes uncured resin. Use IPA (isopropyl alcohol 90%+) or water for water-washable resins. Ultrasonic cleaner improves results. Two-stage wash (dirty then clean IPA) extends solvent life.

Resin post-processing step 2: Curing hardens the print with UV light. Use dedicated curing station or sunlight. Typical cure time 5-15 minutes depending on resin. Overcuring makes parts brittle. Cure supports before removal for easier handling.

Resin safety: Always wear nitrile gloves when handling uncured resin. Safety glasses protect eyes from splashes. Work in ventilated area - resin fumes can cause sensitization. Keep resin off skin - some people develop allergies. Dispose of cured resin as regular waste, liquid resin as hazardous.

Resin PPE requirements: Nitrile gloves (not latex - resin penetrates latex). Safety glasses. Respirator with organic vapor cartridge for extended exposure. Long sleeves to prevent skin contact. Work on covered surface for easy cleanup.

FEP film in resin vat is consumable item. Replace when clouded, scratched, or punctured. Tension must be correct - too loose causes layer separation, too tight risks tearing. Clean with IPA and soft cloth between prints.

KiCad is free, open-source PCB design software used professionally worldwide. Includes schematic editor, PCB layout editor, 3D viewer, and Gerber generation. Cross-platform (Windows, Mac, Linux). Large component library with community additions.

KiCad workflow: Create project, draw schematic with symbols, assign footprints to symbols, generate netlist, import to PCB editor, place components, route traces, run design rule check, generate manufacturing files.

Schematic design captures the logical connections between components. Use standard symbols for components. Connect with wires or labels for distant connections. Add power symbols (VCC, GND) rather than drawing long power wires.

Schematic best practices: Organize into functional blocks. Signal flow generally left-to-right. Add decoupling capacitors near ICs. Label all nets clearly. Use hierarchical sheets for complex designs. Add notes explaining circuit function.

Component footprints define physical size and pad layout for PCB placement. Through-hole components have holes drilled through board. SMD (Surface Mount Device) components solder to pads on surface only. Match footprint to actual component you'll use.

PCB layout starts with board outline and mounting holes. Place components - critical components first, then supporting parts. Keep related components close together. Consider heat dissipation for power components.

PCB trace routing connects component pads according to schematic. Trace width depends on current - 0.25mm minimum for signals, wider for power. Avoid 90° corners (use 45° or curves). Keep high-speed signals short.

PCB ground plane is solid copper area connected to ground. Provides low-impedance return path for signals. Reduces electromagnetic interference. Usually on bottom layer of 2-layer board or inner layers of 4+ layer boards.

Design rules in KiCad define minimum trace width, spacing, via size, etc. Based on PCB manufacturer capabilities. Typical minimums: 0.2mm trace width, 0.2mm spacing, 0.3mm via drill. Check manufacturer specs before design.

Gerber files are industry-standard format for PCB manufacturing. Includes separate files for each copper layer, solder mask, silkscreen, and drill file. KiCad exports directly to Gerber. Most manufacturers accept Gerber plus drill file (Excellon format).

PCB manufacturing services like JLCPCB, PCBWay, OSH Park accept Gerber files online. Upload files, select board specs (layers, color, thickness), receive boards in 1-2 weeks. Minimum order typically 5 boards. Very affordable for prototypes.

Through-hole soldering: Component leads go through drilled holes. Easier to solder by hand. More mechanically robust. Takes more board space. Good for connectors, large components, and prototypes.

SMD soldering requires more skill but enables smaller designs. Use fine-tip soldering iron and thin solder. Apply flux. Magnification helpful for small packages. Hot air rework station useful for multi-pin components and corrections.

SMD component sizes: 0805 and 0603 are hand-solderable with practice. 0402 requires good technique and magnification. 0201 and smaller need stencil and reflow. Common IC packages: SOIC, QFP, QFN - QFN has no leads (pads underneath).

PCB silkscreen is the printed text/graphics layer. Add component designators (R1, C1, U1). Include board name, version, date. Mark pin 1 on ICs. Add polarity indicators for capacitors and diodes. Keep text readable (1mm minimum height).

Embroidery machines stitch designs automatically using thread and needle. Home machines (Brother, Janome) handle small designs. Commercial machines have larger hoops and multiple needles. Designs must be digitized into machine-readable format.

Embroidery digitizing converts images into stitch data. Software includes Ink/Stitch (free), PE-Design, Hatch. Define stitch types: fill stitches for large areas, satin stitches for borders, running stitches for outlines and details.

Embroidery thread comes in polyester (durable, colorfast) or rayon (shiny, softer). Weight typically 40wt for most embroidery. Bobbin uses lighter thread (60-90wt). Match thread tension to fabric for clean stitches.

Embroidery stabilizer supports fabric during stitching. Cut-away for stretchy fabrics (remains permanently). Tear-away for stable fabrics (remove after stitching). Water-soluble for delicate fabrics or free-standing lace. Match stabilizer to fabric and design density.

Hooping technique affects embroidery quality. Fabric should be taut but not stretched. Inner hoop goes underneath, outer hoop presses down. Use hooping aids for hard-to-hoop items. Proper hooping prevents puckering and registration issues.

Embroidery design considerations: Minimum stitch length ~1mm. Maximum stitch length ~7mm (longer stitches snag). Underlay stitches stabilize top stitches. Pull compensation adjusts for fabric stretch. Test designs on scrap fabric first.

3D scanning captures real-world objects as digital 3D models. Applications include reverse engineering, archiving, custom fitting, and creating models for 3D printing. Multiple technologies available at different price points and accuracy levels.

Photogrammetry creates 3D models from multiple photographs. Take 50-200+ photos from all angles with 60-80% overlap between images. Software (Meshroom, Reality Capture, Metashape) calculates 3D points by matching features across photos.

Photogrammetry tips: Use consistent lighting (overcast or diffuse). Matte surfaces work best - spray shiny objects with talc. Include scale reference. Keep camera settings fixed. Move around object rather than rotating object.

Structured light scanning projects pattern onto object and cameras capture distortion. More accurate than photogrammetry for many applications. Desktop scanners (EinScan, Revopoint) affordable for makers. Works poorly on reflective or transparent surfaces.

Turntable scanning rotates object while stationary scanner captures from fixed position. Automates capture process. Good for small to medium objects. Mark turntable with targets for software to track rotation.

3D scan mesh cleanup in software like Meshlab, Meshmixer, or Blender. Fill holes from missing data. Remove noise and floating artifacts. Smooth surface while preserving detail. Decimate (reduce polygon count) for manageable file size.

Scan-to-print workflow: Capture scan, clean mesh, verify watertight (manifold), scale to desired size, add features if needed (mounting holes, flat base), orient for optimal printing, slice and print.

Mesh repair for 3D printing: Models must be watertight (no holes). Normals must face outward. No self-intersecting geometry. Meshlab's filters or Meshmixer's Inspector tool detect and fix common issues automatically.

Hand tools every maker should know: Measuring (calipers, rulers, squares), Marking (pencils, scribes, center punch), Cutting (utility knife, scissors, snips), Gripping (pliers, vise-grips), Screwdriving (multiple sizes and types).

Digital calipers measure dimensions accurately to 0.01mm. Measure outside diameter, inside diameter, depth, and step. Zero before measuring. Clean jaws regularly. Don't overtighten on workpiece. Essential for checking print dimensions.

Screwdriver tips: Match driver to screw exactly - wrong size strips heads. Phillips head is most common but strips easily. Pozidriv looks similar but is different. Torx provides better grip for high torque. Keep screwdrivers organized by type and size.

Workshop safety fundamentals: Know emergency stop locations. Keep work area clean and organized. Never disable safety guards. Use appropriate PPE for each task. No loose clothing, tie back long hair. Stay focused - most accidents happen when distracted.

Power tool safety basics: Read manual before first use. Inspect tools and cords before use. Secure workpiece properly. Keep hands away from cutting areas. Wait for tool to stop completely before setting down. Unplug when changing bits or blades.

Eye protection required when: cutting, grinding, drilling, using compressed air, working with chemicals, soldering. Safety glasses for general work. Face shield for grinding or turning. Goggles for chemical splash protection.

Hearing protection required when operating loud equipment. Sound levels above 85dB cause hearing damage over time. Foam earplugs reduce 20-30dB. Earmuffs more convenient for intermittent noise. Combination provides maximum protection.

Material storage best practices: Store flammable materials in approved cabinet. Keep chemicals in original containers with labels. Store heavy items low, light items high. First-in-first-out rotation prevents old materials. Control humidity for moisture-sensitive materials.

Filament storage: PLA tolerates some humidity but prints better dry. PETG, Nylon, TPU are highly hygroscopic - store with desiccant. Vacuum bags or sealed containers with silica gel. Dry wet filament before printing (4-6 hours in dehydrator).

Workshop organization with shadow boards displays tools with outlines showing where each belongs. Immediately visible what's missing. Keep frequently used tools accessible. Label shelves and containers clearly. Regular cleanup maintains organization.

Fire safety in makerspace: Know extinguisher locations and types (ABC for general, CO2 for electrical). Never leave laser cutters or 3D printers unattended during operation. Keep combustibles away from heat sources. Maintain clear exits.

Sewing machine basics: Upper thread comes from spool through tension discs and needle. Lower thread comes from bobbin in shuttle. Machine creates lockstitch where threads interlock inside fabric. Correct tension creates balanced stitch.

Sewing machine setup: Wind bobbin evenly. Insert bobbin with thread unwinding correct direction. Thread machine following numbered guides. Use correct needle for fabric type. Test on scrap before starting project.

Fabric types for makers: Cotton is versatile and easy to sew. Canvas/duck for heavy-duty projects. Ripstop nylon for lightweight bags. Felt (non-woven) doesn't fray - good for simple projects. Always prewash fabric to prevent shrinkage.

Seam allowance is distance from cut edge to stitch line. Standard is 1.5cm (5/8") for garments, often 1cm or 6mm for crafts. Consistent seam allowance is critical for pieces to fit together. Use seam guide or mark presser foot.

Pattern making starts with measurements or existing garment. Add seam allowance to pattern pieces. Mark grain line (parallel to selvage). Include notches for alignment. Label all pieces with name, quantity, grain line.

E-textiles combine electronics with fabric. Conductive thread (stainless steel or silver-coated) replaces wire. Sewable components include LilyPad Arduino, sewable LEDs, conductive fabric. Insulate connections to prevent shorts.

Conductive thread considerations: Higher resistance than wire - keep traces short. Use multiple strands for lower resistance. Secure knots with clear nail polish or fabric glue. Test continuity before completing project.

Sewable LEDs like LilyPad LEDs have large holes for sewing. Observe polarity - positive and negative sides marked. Sew loops through holes at least 3 times for good connection. Keep positive and negative traces separated.

Soft circuits in wearables: Plan circuit before sewing - changes are difficult. Use snap connectors for removable battery. Consider washability - some components are not washable. Distribute weight of battery for comfort.

Silicone mold making creates flexible molds for casting copies. Two-part silicone (Smooth-On Mold Star, Dragon Skin) mixed by weight or volume. Pot life (working time) and cure time vary by product. Flexible molds release rigid castings easily.

Mold making process: Create or obtain master/pattern. Build mold box around pattern. Mix silicone thoroughly. Pour slowly to minimize bubbles. Vibrate or vacuum chamber removes bubbles. Demold after full cure time.

Two-part molds for complex shapes: Part line divides mold where it separates. Add registration keys (bumps/holes) for alignment. Mold first half, apply release agent, pour second half. Allows casting objects with undercuts.

Release agents prevent materials sticking. Silicone releases from most materials but use release on silicone-to-silicone contact. Wax, petroleum jelly, or commercial releases for other applications. Spray releases give thin, even coat.

Resin casting fills silicone molds with rigid plastic. Polyurethane resins (Smooth-Cast) are common. Mix ratio must be exact. Working time varies from 2-30 minutes. Add colorants, fillers, or inclusions before pouring.

Resin casting tips: Work in ventilated area. Measure accurately by weight for best results. Mix thoroughly including sides and bottom. Pour in thin stream to reduce bubbles. Pressure pot eliminates remaining bubbles.

Plaster casting is inexpensive for decorative items. Plaster of Paris sets quickly (15-30 min). Hydrocal and dental plaster are stronger. Mix plaster into water (not water into plaster) to reduce lumps. Tap mold to release bubbles.

Concrete casting uses cement, sand, and aggregate. GFRC (glass fiber reinforced concrete) creates thin, strong shells. Seal molds as concrete is alkaline. Use release agent. Cure slowly (cover with plastic) for strongest results.

Mold longevity: Silicone molds last 20-50+ castings depending on material cast. Urethane resins are more aggressive than plaster. Store molds flat, away from heat and sunlight. Clean between castings for best results.

Spray painting preparation is 90% of the result. Clean surface thoroughly. Sand for mechanical adhesion (320-400 grit). Apply primer appropriate for material. Tack cloth removes dust before painting. Mask areas not to be painted.

Spray paint technique: Hold can 20-30cm from surface. Keep can moving in smooth passes. Multiple light coats better than one heavy coat. Overlap each pass 50%. Allow flash time between coats per product instructions.

Common spray paint problems: Runs/drips from too heavy application or too close. Orange peel from too far distance or low humidity. Fisheyes from contamination. Dust nibs from dirty environment. Prevention easier than correction.

Clear coat protects paint and adds gloss or matte finish. Apply after final color coat cures. Usually 2-3 clear coats for durability. Wet sand between coats (1500-2000 grit) for mirror finish. Final polish with compound.

Powder coating applies dry powder that melts and cures with heat. More durable than paint. Requires grounding and electrostatic gun. Cure in oven at 180-200°C for 10-20 minutes. DIY possible with toaster oven and cheap gun.

Anodizing aluminum creates hard, colored oxide layer. Type II anodizing for decorative colors. Requires acid bath, power supply, and dye. Process: clean, etch, anodize in sulfuric acid, dye, seal in boiling water.

Wood finishing preserves and beautifies wood. Penetrating finishes (oil, wax) soak into wood. Film finishes (polyurethane, lacquer) coat surface. Choose based on appearance, durability, and application method.

Wood stain adds color while showing grain. Water-based stains dry fast and clean up easily. Oil-based stains penetrate deeper and have longer working time. Gel stains work well on pine and other blotchy woods.

Wood finishing steps: Sand progressively (80, 120, 180, 220 grit). Remove dust completely. Apply stain if desired. Apply finish coats with light sanding (320 grit) between coats. Allow full cure before use.

Lacquer dries fastest (minutes) and builds quickly. Best applied by spray. Nitrocellulose lacquer is traditional. CAB-acrylic lacquer is more durable. Requires good ventilation and proper respirator.

Polyurethane is durable and water-resistant. Oil-based yellows slightly, longer dry time. Water-based stays clear, dries faster. Wipe-on poly builds slowly but minimizes brush marks. Best choice for tabletops and high-wear surfaces.

Design thinking process: Empathize (understand user needs), Define (frame the problem), Ideate (brainstorm solutions), Prototype (build test versions), Test (gather feedback). Iterate through cycles, refining based on learning.

Documentation best practices: Photograph work in progress. Record settings, materials, and techniques used. Note what worked and what didn't. Share knowledge with community. Future you will thank present you.

Version control for design files: Use clear file naming with dates or versions. Keep original files before modifications. Git works for text-based files (code, G-code). Cloud storage provides backup and history for binary files.

Collaborative making: Communicate clearly about project goals. Define roles and responsibilities. Use shared documentation. Regular check-ins prevent misalignment. Celebrate successes and learn from failures together.

Project planning: Break project into tasks. Estimate time for each task (then double it). Identify dependencies - what must happen first. Build in time for iteration and unexpected problems. Set realistic milestones.

Recycling 3D printer filament: Failed prints and supports are recyclable. Filament recyclers (Filabot, Protocycler) melt and extrude new filament. Requires consistent material input for quality output. More practical at community scale.

Reducing 3D printing waste: Right-size prints - smaller is better. Optimize infill - usually 15-20% sufficient. Avoid supports when possible by smart orientation. Batch similar prints to reduce setup waste.

Eco-friendly filament options: PLA is corn-based and industrially compostable (not home compostable). Recycled PETG available from some manufacturers. Wood and paper-filled filaments use waste materials. Avoid ABS when possible due to fumes.

Repair mindset versus replace: Fix before discarding. 3D print replacement parts for broken items. Document repairs to help others. Right-to-repair movement supports access to parts and information. Repair cafes share skills and tools.

Material efficiency: Nest cut parts to minimize waste. Use scraps for small projects or tests. Store offcuts organized for future use. Choose material sizes that match project needs. Consider material lifecycle from sourcing to disposal.

Sustainable workshop practices: LED lighting reduces energy. Power down equipment when not in use. Properly dispose of hazardous waste. Choose low-VOC finishes when possible. Buy quality tools that last. Share resources through tool libraries.

Arduino PID control for temperature: Use PID library for precise control of heaters, ovens, or sous vide. Define Kp, Ki, Kd tuning constants. Input is sensor reading, output is PWM to heater. Start with Kp=2, Ki=5, Kd=1 and tune from there.

Arduino stepper motor acceleration: AccelStepper library provides smooth acceleration/deceleration. stepper.setMaxSpeed(1000); stepper.setAcceleration(500); stepper.moveTo(position); stepper.run() in loop. Prevents missed steps at startup.

Arduino millis() for non-blocking code: Avoid delay() which blocks execution. Use: if (millis() - previousMillis >= interval) { previousMillis = millis(); doAction(); } Allows multiple timed tasks to run concurrently.

Arduino state machine pattern: Define states as enum (IDLE, RUNNING, PAUSED). Switch statement in loop checks currentState. Each state has entry actions, ongoing actions, and transition conditions. Clean way to manage complex behavior.

Arduino debounce button properly: Mechanical buttons bounce causing multiple triggers. Software debounce: if (reading != lastButtonState) { lastDebounceTime = millis(); } if ((millis() - lastDebounceTime) > debounceDelay) { buttonState = reading; }

Arduino EEPROM for persistent storage: EEPROM.write(address, value) saves byte that persists after power off. EEPROM.read(address) retrieves. Limited write cycles (~100,000). Use EEPROM.put() and EEPROM.get() for larger datatypes.

Arduino watchdog timer prevents lockups: #include <avr/wdt.h>, wdt_enable(WDTO_2S) enables 2-second timeout, wdt_reset() in loop resets timer. If loop hangs longer than timeout, Arduino automatically resets.

Arduino interrupt service routine (ISR) best practices: Keep ISRs short - set flag and exit. Use volatile for variables shared with main code. Don't use delay(), Serial.print(), or millis() inside ISR. Disable interrupts briefly when accessing shared variables.

Arduino soft serial for additional serial ports: SoftwareSerial library creates extra serial ports on any pins. SoftwareSerial mySerial(10, 11); // RX, TX. Limited to ~57600 baud. Use for GPS, Bluetooth modules when hardware serial needed for debugging.

Arduino analog reference selection: analogReference(INTERNAL) uses internal 1.1V reference for more precise small voltage measurements. DEFAULT uses 5V. EXTERNAL uses voltage on AREF pin. Choose based on sensor output range.

Raspberry Pi systemd service for auto-start: Create /etc/systemd/system/myapp.service file. Define [Service] with ExecStart=/usr/bin/python3 /home/pi/script.py. Enable with sudo systemctl enable myapp. Runs script automatically at boot.

Raspberry Pi I2C multiple devices: All I2C devices share same SDA/SCL bus. Each has unique address. Use i2cdetect -y 1 to scan. Some devices have configurable addresses via jumpers. Use multiplexer (TCA9548A) if address conflicts exist.

Raspberry Pi camera OpenCV setup: sudo apt install python3-opencv. Import cv2, capture = cv2.VideoCapture(0). ret, frame = capture.read() gets frame. cv2.imshow() displays. Process frames for face detection, motion detection, color tracking.

Raspberry Pi GPIO cleanup: Always GPIO.cleanup() at program end to reset pins to input mode. Use try/finally block to ensure cleanup runs even if program crashes. Prevents issues when restarting scripts.

Raspberry Pi PWM hardware vs software: Hardware PWM on GPIO 12, 13, 18, 19 is precise and CPU-efficient. Software PWM available on all pins but uses CPU and may jitter. Use hardware PWM for servos, motors; software OK for LED dimming.

Raspberry Pi Pico PIO programmable I/O: Custom state machines for precise timing. Create protocols not natively supported. Examples: WS2812 LED control, VGA signal generation, custom serial protocols. More capable than GPIO bit-banging.

Raspberry Pi Pico dual core usage: import _thread; _thread.start_new_thread(function, ()). Run sensor reading on core 0, display update on core 1. Use locks for shared data: lock = _thread.allocate_lock(); lock.acquire(); lock.release().

Raspberry Pi Pico ADC with DMA: Direct Memory Access enables continuous sampling without CPU intervention. Useful for audio input, fast sensor logging. Configure DMA channel to transfer ADC readings directly to memory buffer.

MicroPython vs CircuitPython comparison: Both Python for microcontrollers. MicroPython is original, runs on more boards. CircuitPython by Adafruit, more beginner-friendly, better library support for Adafruit hardware. Code mostly compatible between both.

ESP32 WiFi web server: Connect to WiFi with WiFi.begin(ssid, password). Create server with WiFiServer server(80). In loop: client = server.available(); if (client) read request, send HTML response. Control GPIO from web browser.

ESP32 deep sleep for battery projects: esp_deep_sleep_start() enters lowest power mode (~10µA). Wake on timer: esp_sleep_enable_timer_wakeup(microseconds). Wake on GPIO: esp_sleep_enable_ext0_wakeup(pin, level). Essential for battery-powered IoT sensors.

3D printing threaded holes: Print vertical holes undersized by 0.4mm, then tap threads with hand tap. Or use heat-set threaded inserts - solder iron melts insert into plastic for strong metal threads. M3 inserts most common for maker projects.

3D printing snap-fit joints: Design cantilever snaps with 45° ramp for insertion, 90° stop for retention. PLA needs 2-3% deflection max, PETG allows more. Add fillet at base to prevent stress concentration. Test fit tolerance 0.2-0.4mm.

3D printing living hinges in PLA: Thin section (0.4-0.6mm) flexes repeatedly. Print flat, orient so layer lines run along hinge length. PLA will eventually fatigue; PETG or PP more durable. Multiple narrow hinges better than one wide one.

3D printing press-fit tolerances: Hole 0.1-0.2mm smaller than shaft for interference fit. Test with calibration prints - every printer different. PETG grips better than PLA. Vertical holes more accurate than horizontal due to layer orientation.

3D printing bridging optimization: Maximum unsupported span depends on cooling and speed. Enable bridge settings in slicer. Slow bridge speed (20-30mm/s), high fan (100%). Good bridges possible up to 50-80mm with tuned settings.

3D printing vase mode (spiralize): Single continuous extrusion spiraling up creates watertight, fast prints. No Z-seam. Works for simple vases, cups, lampshades. Set wall thickness to 2-3 nozzle widths for strength. No infill, no top layers.

3D printing overhang angles: 45° overhangs print without support on most printers. Up to 60-70° possible with good cooling. Steeper angles need support. Use variable support: none for 45°, interface layers for steeper sections.

3D printing ironing for smooth tops: Extra pass over top layer to smooth surface. Minimal extrusion, slow speed. Creates glass-like finish but adds print time. Most effective with 0.1mm layers and flat top surfaces.

3D printing seam hiding strategies: Place seam at corners (sharpest corner setting). Aligned seam creates visible line but predictable. Random distributes but creates scattered dots. Use coasting and wipe to reduce seam visibility.

3D printing retraction tuning tower: Print retraction test with varying settings. Find minimum retraction that eliminates stringing. Too much retraction causes gaps and clogs. Direct drive: 0.5-2mm. Bowden: 4-7mm.

Fusion 360 parametric design: Use parameters (Modify > Change Parameters) for dimensions. Create user parameters for key measurements. Change one value, entire model updates. Essential for design iteration and customization.

Fusion 360 joints and motion: Use joints (Assemble > Joint) to connect components. Revolute for hinges, slider for linear motion, rigid for fixed. Animate joints to verify mechanism works. Detect collisions during motion study.

Fusion 360 pattern features: Create rectangular pattern for rows/columns of features. Circular pattern around axis for radial arrays. Pattern on path follows sketch curve. Patterns update automatically when source feature changes.

Meshmixer support generation: Generate supports (Analysis > Overhangs) specifically designed for 3D printing. Tree supports use less material than standard. Adjust angle threshold, density, tip diameter. Export supports separately if needed.

STL export settings in CAD: Set resolution/tolerance for mesh density. Finer mesh (0.01mm) for detailed models, coarser (0.1mm) for simple shapes. Binary STL smaller than ASCII. Check model is manifold before export.

Design for FDM: Avoid small overhangs, prefer 45° chamfers. Minimum wall 2x nozzle diameter. Orient cylindrical features vertically for best accuracy. Add mouse ears for small footprint parts prone to warping.

Multi-material printing strategies: Use MMU or tool changer for automatic color changes. Manual filament swap at layer change for simple multi-color. Design interlocking parts in different colors assembled after printing.

3D printed gears: Module determines gear size (tooth spacing). Use involute tooth profile. Minimum ~12 teeth to avoid undercutting. Print gears flat for best tooth accuracy. PETG or nylon more durable than PLA for functional gears.

3D printed bearings: Print-in-place bearings possible with proper clearance (0.3-0.5mm). Ball bearings need separate balls inserted. Linear bearings use PTFE tube inserts. For loads, use metal bearings in printed housings.

3D printed enclosure design: Plan for electronics mounting with standoffs. Add ventilation holes for heat. Include cable management (clips, channels). Design access panels for maintenance. Add labels directly in model.

3D printing text and logos: Minimum text height 5mm for readability with 0.4mm nozzle. Embossed text (raised) easier than engraved. Sans-serif fonts print better. Use SVG import for logos, extrude to 0.6-1.2mm depth.

PrusaSlicer custom supports: Use paint-on supports for precise control. Block supports where removal is difficult. Add supports only where truly needed. Organic supports reduce material and print time.

Cura tree supports: Grows from build plate up to overhangs like branches. Uses less material than normal supports. Easier to remove. Enable experimental tree support. Adjust branch diameter and angle.

Print-in-place hinges: Design hinge with 0.3-0.5mm clearance. Print flat on bed, hinge axis vertical. First few movements may be stiff - work hinge to free. PETG works better than PLA for durability.

Lithophane printing: Convert photo to grayscale, generate varying thickness (thicker = darker). Print in white PLA at 100% infill, 0.1mm layers. Display with backlight. Orient for maximum detail (XZ plane recommended).

3D printed molds for casting: Print negative shape as mold. Add draft angles (2-3°) for easy demolding. Smooth or coat interior for better surface. ABS can be acetone smoothed. Or print positive and make silicone mold.

Topology optimization: Generative design in Fusion 360 calculates optimal material placement for loads. Creates organic, efficient structures. Requires 3D printing as traditional manufacturing can't produce these shapes.

Finite element analysis (FEA) for prints: Simulate loads on 3D model before printing. Identify stress concentrations. Adjust design or infill accordingly. Fusion 360, OnShape, FreeFEM provide FEA capabilities.

Variable infill density: Gradient infill puts more material where needed. Modifier meshes in slicer define regions with different infill. Stronger near mounting holes, lighter in body. Reduces weight and print time.

Arduino data logging to SD: SD.begin(chipSelect), File dataFile = SD.open("log.csv", FILE_WRITE), dataFile.println(data). Log sensor readings with timestamps. Retrieve SD card to analyze data on computer.

Knitting basics: Two needles create interlocking loops of yarn. Knit stitch (insert right needle front-to-back, wrap yarn, pull through) and purl stitch (insert back-to-front) are foundation. Alternating rows creates stockinette; same stitch each row creates garter stitch.

Knitting needle sizes: Metric 2mm-25mm, US 0-50. Thicker needles = looser, larger stitches. Match needle size to yarn weight recommendation on label. Circular needles good for large projects, double-pointed for small circumferences like socks.

Yarn weights: Lace (0), Fingering (1), Sport (2), DK (3), Worsted (4), Bulky (5), Super Bulky (6), Jumbo (7). Weight affects drape, warmth, and needle size. Worsted most common for beginners.

Knitting gauge swatch: Knit 4x4 inch sample, count stitches and rows per inch. Compare to pattern requirements. Adjust needle size if needed - smaller needles for tighter gauge, larger for looser. Essential for proper sizing.

Casting on methods: Long-tail cast on most versatile and stretchy. Knitted cast on simple for beginners. Cable cast on creates firm edge. German twisted cast on extra stretchy for socks. Choose based on project edge needs.

Binding off knitting: Basic bind off: knit 2, pass first over second, repeat. Stretchy bind off for ribbed edges. Three-needle bind off joins two pieces together. Maintain consistent tension for neat edge.

Knitting increases and decreases: KFB (knit front back) increases one stitch. K2tog (knit two together) decreases right-leaning. SSK (slip slip knit) decreases left-leaning. Used for shaping garments.

Knitting in the round: Circular needles or double-pointed needles (DPNs) create seamless tubes. Magic loop technique uses long circular for small circumferences. Always knit (never purl) for stockinette in round.

Reading knitting patterns: CO = cast on, K = knit, P = purl, BO = bind off, RS = right side, WS = wrong side. Asterisks (*) indicate repeats. Brackets [] show stitch counts. Read charts bottom to top, right to left for RS rows.

Fixing knitting mistakes: Dropped stitch - use crochet hook to ladder back up. Wrong stitch - tink (unknit) back stitch by stitch. Major error - insert lifeline (waste yarn through stitches), rip back to lifeline.

Crocheting basics: Single hook creates loops through previous loops. Chain stitch is foundation. Single crochet (sc), half double (hdc), double crochet (dc) vary in height. Amigurumi uses tight single crochet in spiral.

Crochet vs knitting: Crochet uses one hook, creates stiffer fabric, easier to correct mistakes, better for 3D shapes (amigurumi). Knitting uses two needles, creates drapier fabric, better for garments, more stretch.

Cricut weeding vinyl: After cutting, remove excess vinyl around design. Use weeding tool (hook) to pick up small pieces. Good lighting essential. Weed intricate designs in sections. Keep design on backing until transfer.

Cricut transfer tape application: Apply transfer tape over weeded design, burnish with scraper. Peel backing, position on surface. Burnish again, slowly peel transfer tape at 45° angle. Dry application for most surfaces.

Cricut iron-on (HTV) basics: Heat Transfer Vinyl applied with heat. Mirror image before cutting (vinyl placed shiny side down). Cut, weed, apply with heat press or iron. Peel carrier sheet warm or cold depending on type.

Heat press vs iron for HTV: Heat press provides even temperature and pressure, more consistent results. Iron works but requires more attention - keep moving, apply pressure. EasyPress is middle ground - even heat, portable.

Heat press temperatures: HTV on cotton 305-320°F (150-160°C) for 10-15 seconds. Polyester lower temp 270-285°F to avoid scorching. Check vinyl manufacturer specs. Peel warm or cold per instructions.

Heat press pressure: Medium-firm pressure for most HTV. Too light = poor adhesion. Too heavy = vinyl pushed into fabric texture. Use pressing pillow inside shirts for even pressure over seams.

Layering HTV vinyl: Apply bottom layer first, full time/temp. Each additional layer shorter time (5-10 seconds). Maximum 3 layers recommended. Use low-tack HTV for top layers. Plan color order - light colors last.

Sublimation printing basics: Special ink turns to gas under heat, bonds with polyester. Requires polyester fabric or poly-coated substrates. Print mirror image on sublimation paper. 385-400°F for 45-60 seconds.

Sublimation vs HTV: Sublimation is permanent, no texture, won't crack or peel, vibrant colors, full-color images. HTV adds texture, can crack over time, better for cotton. Sublimation limited to white/light polyester.

Button maker (badge maker) basics: Hand press or pneumatic machine. Components: shell (top), mylar cover, pin back, collet. Place printed design in shell, position mylar, press front. Flip, add pin back, press again.

Button maker sizes: Common sizes 1", 1.25", 1.5", 2.25", 3". Each size needs matching die set. 1.25" most popular for promotional buttons. Larger sizes for detailed artwork. Consider pin back vs magnet back vs bottle opener.

Designing for buttons: Design larger than final size - some image wraps around edge. Use template with safe zone marked. Bold, simple designs read better small. CMYK for printing. 300 DPI minimum resolution.

Button cutter tools: Circle cutter creates perfect circles from printed sheets. Adjustable cutters for multiple sizes. Cutting mat underneath protects surface. Alternative: Cricut or Silhouette with circle cut.

Screen printing basics: Stencil method - mesh screen blocks ink except where image burns through. Photo emulsion coated on screen, exposed with UV, washed to create stencil. Squeegee pushes ink through onto substrate.

Screen printing for makers: Simple setup with screen, photo emulsion, UV light (sun or lamp), squeegee. One screen per color. Good for batch production of same design. Water-based inks easier cleanup than plastisol.

DTF (Direct to Film) printing: Print on special film, apply adhesive powder, cure, heat transfer to fabric. Works on any fabric color. No weeding required. Full-color, photographic prints possible. Newer technology gaining popularity.

Embossing and debossing: Embossing raises design above surface. Debossing presses design into surface. Heat embossing uses powder and heat gun on wet ink. Dry embossing uses stylus and stencil. Adds tactile dimension to paper crafts.

Paper crafting basics: Cardstock weight measured in GSM (grams per square meter) or lb. 65lb/176gsm for cards, 80lb/216gsm for sturdy bases. Scoring creates clean folds. Bone folder for crisp creases.

Bookbinding basics: Signatures (folded paper groups) sewn together. Coptic stitch exposes spine, lays flat. Japanese stab binding decorative, side-sewn. Perfect binding uses glue (paperback style). Saddle stitch for thin booklets.

Leather crafting basics: Vegetable-tanned leather for tooling and molding. Chrome-tanned for garments, softer. Leather thickness in ounces (1oz = 1/64 inch). Beveler, swivel knife, stamps for tooling. Saddle stitch is strongest hand stitch.

Macramé basics: Decorative knotting technique. Square knot and spiral knot most common. Lark's head knot attaches cord to dowel. Natural cotton rope 3-5mm for wall hangings. Plan pattern, calculate cord length (usually 4x finished length).

Weaving basics: Warp threads held taut on loom, weft threads woven through. Tabby/plain weave over-under alternating. Rigid heddle looms beginner-friendly. Frame looms simplest for small projects. Tapestry weaving creates images.

Pottery without kiln: Air-dry clay requires no firing, not waterproof. Polymer clay cures in home oven 275°F. Paper clay lightweight, air dries. Cold porcelain (DIY clay) air dries, very smooth. Seal with varnish for durability.

Resin art basics: Two-part epoxy resin mixed by volume or weight. Working time 20-40 minutes. Full cure 24-72 hours. Add pigments, glitter, dried flowers. Pour in molds or over surfaces. Heat gun removes bubbles.

Candle making basics: Paraffin (traditional), soy (clean burn), beeswax (natural), coconut (creamy). Container candles easiest. Match wick size to container diameter. Fragrance load 6-10%. Pour temp varies by wax type.

Soap making cold process: Lye + fats = soap (saponification). Calculate lye precisely with soap calculator. Safety: lye is caustic, wear protection. Pour at trace (pudding consistency). Cure 4-6 weeks.

Jewelry making basics: Wire wrapping uses no solder. Wire gauge: higher number = thinner. 20-22 gauge for wrapping, 16-18 for structure. Round, half-round, square profiles. Chain nose, round nose, flush cutters essential.

Punch needle embroidery: Loop pile created by pushing yarn through fabric. Adjustable needle for different loop heights. Monk's cloth or weaver's cloth fabric. Design transfers to back (yarn side). Fun, quick results.

Tufting gun basics: Power tool for making rugs. Cut pile (loop cut) or loop pile. Tufting cloth stretched on frame. Primary backing, apply latex adhesive, add secondary backing. 5mm or 8mm pile height common.

Design Thinking process: Five stages - Empathize (understand users), Define (identify problem), Ideate (generate ideas), Prototype (build solutions), Test (validate with users). Non-linear, iterate between stages as learning happens.

Empathize stage: Interview users, observe behavior in context. Ask open questions: "Tell me about a time when..." Shadow users doing tasks. Create empathy maps: what users say, think, do, feel. Suspend judgment, seek to understand.

Define stage: Synthesize research into actionable problem statement. Point of View (POV): [User] needs [need] because [insight]. "How Might We" (HMW) questions reframe problems as opportunities. Narrow focus to tractable challenge.

Ideate stage: Quantity over quality initially. Defer judgment, encourage wild ideas. Build on others' ideas ("Yes, and..."). One conversation at a time. Visual and spatial thinking. Separate generation from evaluation phases.

Brainstorming rules: No criticism during ideation. Go for quantity (100+ ideas in session). Welcome unusual ideas. Combine and improve ideas. Stay focused on topic. Be visual - sketch ideas. Time-boxed sessions (15-30 min).

Brainwriting 6-3-5: Six people, three ideas each, five minutes. Write ideas, pass paper, build on previous ideas. Silent brainstorming reduces social inhibition. Everyone contributes equally. 108 potential ideas in 30 minutes.

SCAMPER technique: Substitute, Combine, Adapt, Modify, Put to other uses, Eliminate, Reverse/Rearrange. Apply each prompt to existing product/idea. Systematic way to explore variations. Forces consideration of alternatives.

Mind mapping: Central concept in middle, branches radiate outward. Free association, visual thinking. Use colors, images, keywords. Reveals connections between ideas. Software: Miro, MindMeister, FreeMind. Paper works great too.

Crazy 8s: Fold paper into 8 sections. 8 ideas in 8 minutes (1 minute per idea). Forces quick thinking, prevents overthinking. Sketch rough concepts, words allowed. Share and discuss after. Popular in design sprints.

Worst Possible Idea: Deliberately generate terrible solutions. Removes fear of judgment. Often contains seeds of good ideas when inverted. Energizing, fun team exercise. "What would make this problem worse?"

Reverse brainstorming: Instead of solving problem, brainstorm ways to cause it. Then reverse those for solutions. "How could we make customers hate our product?" reveals what matters. Different perspective unlocks thinking.

Analogy thinking: How does nature solve this? (Biomimicry). How do other industries handle similar problems? What if this were a restaurant/hospital/game? Force connections between unrelated domains. Velcro invented from burrs.

Constraints as creativity: Artificial limitations spark innovation. "What if it cost $0?" "What if it had to fit in pocket?" "What if a child had to use it?" Constraints force new approaches, prevent default thinking.

First principles thinking: Break problem down to fundamental truths. Question every assumption. Rebuild solution from basic principles rather than analogy. Elon Musk uses for battery costs, rocket reusability. Hard but powerful.

Jobs To Be Done (JTBD): People hire products to do jobs. Focus on progress user wants to make, not demographics. "When [situation], I want to [motivation], so I can [outcome]." Reveals true competition and innovation opportunities.

Problem framing: "We need a bigger drill" vs "We need a hole" vs "We need to hang a picture" vs "We need to feel at home." Reframing at different levels reveals different solutions. Five Whys reaches root cause.

Observation techniques: Fly on wall (observe without interaction). Contextual inquiry (observe and ask). Day in the life (extended shadowing). Photo/video ethnography. Look for workarounds, frustrations, adaptations. Behavior over opinions.

User journey mapping: Visualize user experience over time. Stages, actions, thoughts, emotions, pain points, opportunities. End-to-end view reveals moments that matter. Cross-functional alignment tool. Identifies where to focus innovation.

Personas: Fictional characters representing user types. Based on research, not assumptions. Include goals, frustrations, behaviors, context. Keep visible during design. Don't design for everyone - design for specific persona.

Rapid prototyping philosophy: Build to think, not to prove. Fail early, fail often, fail cheaply. Prototype the riskiest assumption first. Fidelity matches question being answered. Speed over perfection.

Paper prototyping: Sketches and cutouts simulate interfaces. Fast, cheap, low commitment. Users understand it's incomplete. Test flow, not details. Good for early exploration. Anyone can participate.

Wizard of Oz prototype: Human simulates technology behind the scenes. Test concept without building backend. User thinks system is real. Reveals whether solution is desirable before investing in feasibility.

Storyboarding: Comic strip showing user experience. Scenario-based, shows context. Visualizes concept without building. Identifies gaps in thinking. Forces sequential thinking. Shareable with stakeholders.

Physical prototyping progression: Cardboard (form, scale, rough ergonomics). Foam core (more refined form). 3D printed (functional geometry). Machined (final materials). Each stage answers different questions.

Prototype fidelity spectrum: Low-fi (sketches, paper, cardboard) tests concepts, flows, broad reactions. High-fi (looks and works like real thing) tests usability, details, desirability. Match fidelity to learning goal.

Minimum Viable Product (MVP): Smallest thing that delivers value and enables learning. Not half a product, but simplest complete solution. Build-Measure-Learn cycle. Validate market before scaling features.

Assumption mapping: List all assumptions about users, problem, solution, business. Rate by importance and uncertainty. Test riskiest assumptions first. Kills ideas early before major investment.

Experiment design: Hypothesis (testable prediction). Method (how to test). Metrics (how to measure). Criteria (what success looks like). Document everything. One variable at a time ideally.

Prototyping materials: Cardboard - free, cuttable, foldable. Foam board - clean edges, lightweight. Hot glue - fast assembly. Tape - non-permanent attachment. Dowels - structural elements. Found objects - rapid mock-ups.

Service blueprinting: Map customer actions, frontstage (visible), backstage (invisible), support processes. Reveals full system needed to deliver experience. Identifies failures points. Connects experience to operations.

Concept testing: Show multiple concepts to users. Preference tests ("which do you prefer"). Reaction tests (first impressions). Comprehension tests (do they understand). Iterated based on feedback.

A/B testing: Two versions, measure which performs better. Single variable difference. Sufficient sample size for significance. Online tools: Google Optimize, Optimizely. Data-driven decision making.

Think-aloud testing: Users verbalize thoughts while using prototype. Reveals mental model, confusion points. Don't help or explain. "What are you thinking right now?" Record for team review.

Cognitive walkthrough: Expert evaluates step-by-step. At each step: Will user try correct action? Will they notice it's available? Will they understand it's what they want? Will they know they're progressing?

Heuristic evaluation: Experts evaluate against usability principles (Nielsen's 10 heuristics). Visibility, feedback, consistency, error prevention, recognition over recall, flexibility, aesthetic, help users with errors, documentation.

Iteration cycles: Build-test-learn-repeat. Each cycle informed by previous. Track what was changed and why. Convergent (refining one direction) vs divergent (exploring options) phases alternate.

Pivot vs persevere: Based on learning, continue current direction or change strategy. Types of pivots: customer segment, problem, solution, technology, channel, revenue model. Pivoting is learning, not failure.

Design critique best practices: Present context first. Critiquer asks clarifying questions. Feedback specific and actionable. "It seems like..." not "You should..." Presenter doesn't defend, just listens. Focus on goals, not preferences.

Documentation for makers: Photograph every stage. Note settings, materials, quantities. Record what didn't work and why. Version your files. Written instructions enable reproducibility. Share knowledge openly.

Project scoping: Define must-haves vs nice-to-haves. What's the deadline? What resources available? What can be descoped if needed? Smaller scope, completed, beats ambitious scope, unfinished.

Time estimation for projects: Break into small tasks. Estimate each task. Add contingency (often 50-100%). Track actual vs estimated. Learn from patterns. Hofstadter's Law: It always takes longer than you expect, even when you take this law into account.

Creative confidence: Belief in ability to create change. Built through small wins. Failure is learning opportunity. Everyone is creative. Practice expands creative ability. Stanford d.school principle.

Growth mindset for makers: Abilities develop through dedication and hard work. Embrace challenges. Persist through setbacks. Learn from criticism. Find inspiration in others' success. "I can't do this... yet."

Innovation pipeline stages: Discovery (understand opportunity), Definition (frame the challenge), Development (create solutions), Delivery (implement and scale). Double Diamond model: diverge then converge twice.

Discovery phase activities: Trend scanning, competitive analysis, technology scouting, user research, expert interviews, analogous inspiration. Open exploration before narrowing. Document all findings.

Definition phase activities: Synthesis workshops, insight generation, opportunity framing, design principles, success criteria. Transform research into actionable briefs. Align team on direction.

Development phase activities: Ideation sessions, concept development, prototyping, user testing, iteration. Multiple concepts early, converge through testing. Kill weak concepts early.

Delivery phase activities: Final design specification, pilot testing, manufacturing planning, launch planning, measurement framework. Attention to detail. Scale what works.

Stage-gate process: Formal checkpoints between phases. Review criteria at each gate. Go/kill/pivot decisions. Prevents zombie projects. Common in corporate innovation.

Lean Startup methodology: Build-Measure-Learn loop. Validated learning over opinions. Pivot or persevere based on data. Minimum Viable Product tests hypotheses. Continuous deployment enables rapid iteration.

Design Sprint (Google Ventures): Five-day process for answering critical questions. Monday: Map problem. Tuesday: Sketch solutions. Wednesday: Decide direction. Thursday: Build prototype. Friday: Test with users.

From idea to product: Opportunity identification → Research → Ideation → Concept selection → Prototyping → Testing → Refinement → Production planning → Launch → Iteration post-launch.

Technology Readiness Levels (TRL): Scale 1-9 measuring technology maturity. TRL 1: Basic principles observed. TRL 4: Lab validation. TRL 6: Prototype demonstration. TRL 9: Actual system proven. NASA originated, widely adopted.

Value Proposition Canvas: Zoom into customer-product fit. Customer jobs, pains, gains on one side. Products, pain relievers, gain creators on other. Map how solution addresses customer needs.

Product-Market Fit: Product satisfies strong market demand. Signs: organic growth, high retention, customers complaining when it's down. Get to PMF before scaling. Marc Andreessen coined term.

Crossing the Chasm: Technology adoption lifecycle. Innovators → Early Adopters → (CHASM) → Early Majority → Late Majority → Laggards. Different strategies for each segment. Chasm between visionaries and pragmatists.

Blue Ocean Strategy: Create uncontested market space rather than compete in existing markets (red ocean). Value innovation: pursue differentiation and low cost simultaneously. Four actions: eliminate, reduce, raise, create.

Cricut vinyl application tips: Clean surface with isopropyl alcohol. Apply at room temperature. For curves and rivets, heat vinyl slightly with hair dryer. Use hinge method for large decals - tape center, flip sides.

Vinyl for mugs and tumblers: Use permanent outdoor vinyl. Apply to clean, dry surface. For curves, cut design into sections or use vertical cuts. Heat gun helps vinyl conform to curves. Consider epoxy coating over vinyl for durability.

Weeding tips for intricate designs: Warm vinyl slightly to lift easier. Work in sections. Reverse weed (remove design, keep background) for some projects. Use bright light and magnification. Patience is essential.

Car decal application: Clean surface thoroughly. Wet application (soapy water) allows repositioning. Squeegee from center outward. Remove bubbles by pricking with pin. Wait 24-48 hours before washing.

Stencil making with vinyl: Use removable vinyl or stencil vinyl. Weed away the design (keep background). Apply to surface, paint over, remove while paint is tacky. Multiple uses possible with stencil vinyl.

Sublimation blanks: Mugs, tumblers, shirts (polyester), mousepads, puzzles, ornaments, phone cases, coasters, dog tags, license plates. Must have polyester coating or be polyester fabric. White or light colors only.

Sublimation troubleshooting: Blurry image - movement during pressing, need more pressure. Faded colors - wrong time/temp, not enough ink. Ghosting - paper shifted, secure with heat tape. Colors wrong - ICC profile issue.

T-shirt business basics: Heat press essential for volume. Bulk blank shirts from wholesalers (Bella+Canvas, Gildan, Next Level). Price: materials + labor + overhead + profit margin. Consider print-on-demand for testing designs.

Survey question types: Multiple choice (easy to analyze). Likert scale (1-5 agreement, satisfaction). Open text (rich but time-consuming to analyze). Matrix (multiple items, same scale). Ranking (preference order). Avoid leading questions.

Survey best practices: One concept per question. Avoid double negatives. Randomize answer order to reduce bias. Required questions carefully (causes abandonment). Progress bar encourages completion. Mobile-friendly format.

Card sorting: Users organize topics into groups that make sense to them. Reveals mental models for information architecture. Open sort (users create categories) vs closed sort (predefined categories). 15-30 participants typically sufficient.

Card sorting tools: OptimalWorkshop, UXtweak, Proven by Users. Physical cards work for in-person. 30-60 cards typical. Ask users to think aloud. Analyze with similarity matrix. Informs navigation and labeling.

Tree testing: Validates information architecture. Text-only tree structure, users find items. Measures success rate and directness. Complement to card sorting. Test after card sorting informs structure.

Tree testing metrics: Success rate (found correct location). Directness (first click correct). Time to complete. Path analysis (where users go wrong). 50+ participants for statistical confidence.

Usability testing basics: Watch real users attempt tasks with your product. Think-aloud protocol reveals thought process. 5 users find 80% of usability issues. Remote or in-person. Moderated or unmoderated.

Usability testing tasks: Realistic scenarios users would actually do. Task success, time on task, errors measured. Post-task questions (difficulty rating). Post-test questionnaire (SUS score). Combine with interviews for why.

Contextual inquiry: Observation and interview in user's environment. See actual context, tools, workarounds. Master-apprentice model. Rich insights but time-intensive. 6-8 participants typical. Document with notes, photos, video.

Diary studies: Participants log experiences over days/weeks. Captures behavior in natural context over time. Daily prompts via app or form. Rich longitudinal data. Compensation essential for commitment.

Accessibility design principles: Perceivable (can users sense content). Operable (can users interact). Understandable (can users comprehend). Robust (works with assistive tech). WCAG 2.1 guidelines provide specifics.

Accessibility POUR principles: Perceivable - text alternatives, captions, contrast. Operable - keyboard navigation, enough time, no seizure triggers. Understandable - readable, predictable, error help. Robust - compatible with assistive tech.

Color accessibility: 4.5:1 contrast ratio for normal text (WCAG AA). 3:1 for large text. Don't convey information by color alone. Test with colorblindness simulators. Tools: WebAIM contrast checker, Stark plugin.

Keyboard accessibility: All functions available via keyboard. Visible focus indicator. Logical tab order. Skip links for navigation. No keyboard traps. Test by unplugging mouse.

Screen reader design: Alt text for images (descriptive, concise). Heading hierarchy (H1-H6 in order). Meaningful link text (not "click here"). ARIA labels when needed. Form labels associated with inputs.

Inclusive design vs accessibility: Accessibility is minimum compliance (can they use it?). Inclusive design considers full diversity from start. Design for edge cases benefits everyone. Microsoft Inclusive Design toolkit excellent resource.

Universal design principles: Equitable use (useful for diverse abilities). Flexibility in use (accommodates preferences). Simple and intuitive. Perceptible information (multiple modes). Tolerance for error. Low physical effort. Size and space for approach and use.

Participatory design principles: Mutual learning (designers and users). Democratic practices. Tools that don't require design skills. Iterations include participants. Final users have real influence on outcome.

Generative research: Understand user contexts, needs, desires before defining problem. Unlike evaluative research (testing solutions). Informs problem space. Open exploration. Often uses co-design methods.

Service design definition: Designing complete experiences across touchpoints. Front-stage (customer-facing) and back-stage (internal operations). Services as journeys over time. Holistic system view.

Service blueprint components: Customer actions (what users do). Frontstage (visible interactions). Backstage (invisible employee actions). Support processes (systems enabling service). Physical evidence (tangible elements).

Customer journey map: Visualize customer experience stages. Actions, thoughts, emotions at each stage. Pain points and opportunities highlighted. Aligns team around customer perspective. Based on research, not assumptions.

Touchpoint analysis: Every interaction between customer and service. Physical (store, product), digital (website, app), human (staff). Each touchpoint shapes overall experience. Consistency across touchpoints essential.

Service safari: Experience competitor or analogous services as customer. Document journey, touchpoints, emotions. Fresh perspective on service experience. Reveals opportunities and best practices.

Speculative design: Imagining possible futures through design. Not predicting, but provoking thought and debate. "What if?" scenarios. Critical design questions assumptions. Fiction as design tool.

Design fiction: Creating artifacts from imaginary futures. Props, prototypes, videos, stories. Makes abstract futures tangible. Sparks conversation about implications. Near future more relatable than far future.

Speculative design process: Research trends and signals. Identify tensions and possibilities. Create future scenarios. Design artifacts from that future. Present and discuss implications. Not about likelihood but possibility.

Scenarios and personas for futures: Future personas (who might exist). Day-in-life scenarios (how they live). Interaction scenarios (with speculative technology). Rich narrative brings futures to life.

Backcasting: Start with desired future state. Work backward to identify steps to get there. Alternative to forecasting (extending present). Useful for sustainability, strategy. "How might we get there?"

Signals and trends: Signals are early indicators of change. Trends are patterns of signals. Weak signals easy to miss but important. Scan broadly - technology, society, environment, politics. Connect signals to implications.

Horizon scanning: Systematic examination of potential threats and opportunities. Three horizons: now (operational), medium (emerging), far (transformational). Informs strategy and innovation.

Product photography basics: Clean background, consistent lighting, sharp focus. Shows product clearly from multiple angles. White background for ecommerce. Styled shots for social media. Tripod essential for consistency.

Photo angles for products: Front (primary listing image). 45-degree (shows dimension). Side profile. Top-down (flat lay). Detail shots (texture, features). Scale reference (with hand or common object). 5-7 images per product typical.

Flat lay photography: Arrange items on flat surface, shoot from above. Grid layout or organic arrangement. Odd numbers of items more pleasing. Props add context but don't distract. Consistent spacing between elements.

Smartphone product photography: Use rear camera (higher quality). Clean lens. Tripod or stable surface. Natural light. Portrait mode for depth. Edit in Lightroom Mobile or Snapseed. Good enough for many platforms.

Social media for makers: Visual platforms (Instagram, TikTok, Pinterest) ideal for crafts. Show process, not just finished product. Behind-the-scenes builds connection. Consistent posting schedule. Engage with community, don't just broadcast.

Instagram for makers: Grid aesthetic (cohesive look). Reels for reach (tutorials, process videos). Stories for daily engagement. Shopping tags for products. Hashtag research (mix popular and niche). Save posts to highlight collections.

TikTok for makers: Short entertaining videos (15-60 seconds). Trending sounds boost visibility. Process videos (satisfying to watch). Tutorial snippets. Authentic over polished. Post consistently (1-2x daily ideal). Engage with comments.

Pinterest for makers: Search engine more than social network. Rich pins for products. Keywords in descriptions. Vertical images perform best. Link to shop or blog. Seasonal content months in advance. Boards organize by theme.

Content batching: Create multiple posts in one session. Photograph several products at once. Write captions together. Schedule with tools (Later, Planoly, Buffer). Efficient use of creative energy. Maintain consistency.

Hashtag strategy: Mix of sizes - large (visibility), medium (discoverability), small niche (engaged community). Research competitor hashtags. Create branded hashtag. Don't use banned hashtags. 20-30 per post on Instagram.

Building audience: Post consistently (quality over quantity). Engage authentically with others. Collaborate with similar makers. User-generated content (repost customer photos). Give value (tips, tutorials) not just sales.

Shipping materials: Boxes (corrugated for protection). Poly mailers (lightweight, flexible). Bubble wrap/air pillows (void fill). Tissue paper (presentation). Packing peanuts (avoid - environmental). Tape (branded custom tape optional).

Right-sizing packages: Smallest box that fits product safely. Less material, lower shipping cost, less waste. Stock 3-4 box sizes. Mailers for flexible/durable items. Fragile items need extra cushion.

Eco-friendly packaging: Recycled cardboard. Paper tape instead of plastic. Shredded paper for void fill. Compostable mailers (check local facilities). Reused boxes (inform customer). Minimal packaging where safe.

Branded packaging experience: Custom tissue paper. Thank you card with care instructions. Small freebie or sample. Business card for reorders. Handwritten note (personal touch). Consistent brand colors.

Shipping carriers comparison: USPS (best for small packages, flat rate options). UPS (reliable, better for heavy). FedEx (fast, business focus). DHL (international). Pirate Ship for discounted rates. Compare by package dimensions and distance.

Shipping cost strategies: Build into product price (free shipping). Flat rate shipping. Real-time calculated rates. Free shipping threshold ($50+ orders). Local pickup option. Clearly communicate policy.

International shipping: Customs forms required. HS codes for product categories. Value declaration accurate. Consider duties/taxes (DDP vs DDU). Longer delivery times. Higher loss/damage risk. Price accordingly.

Fragile item shipping: Double-box method (inner box cushioned inside outer). Wrap each item individually. "Fragile" stickers (limited effectiveness). Consider shipping insurance. Test by shaking package.

Copyright basics for makers: Automatic protection when work is created. Covers original creative works. You own copyright to your designs. Registration provides legal benefits. Life of creator plus 70 years.

What copyright protects: Original artwork, patterns, photographs, written content. Does not protect ideas, facts, titles, names, short phrases. Expression of idea protected, not idea itself.

Copyright infringement: Using someone else's work without permission. Fan art legal gray area (technically infringement). Parody has more protection. "Inspired by" safer than copying. When in doubt, create original.

Fair use factors: Purpose (commercial vs educational). Nature of original work. Amount used. Effect on market. Transformative use more likely fair. Not a clear-cut rule - case by case.

Trademark basics: Protects brand identifiers (names, logos, slogans). Must be used in commerce. Registration provides stronger protection. ™ for unregistered, ® for registered. Prevents consumer confusion.

Trademark clearance: Search USPTO database before using name. Google search for similar uses. Domain availability. Social media handle availability. Consider hiring trademark attorney for comprehensive search.

Licensing copyrighted material: Get permission or pay for license. Stock images (Shutterstock, Creative Market). Font licenses for commercial use. Commercial-use fabric prints. Document all licenses.

Protecting your work: Copyright registration for important designs. Trademark your brand name. Document creation dates. Watermark online images. Terms of service on website. Act on infringements promptly.

Pattern and design copyright: Original patterns copyrightable. Cannot copyright a technique. Finished items from commercial patterns - check license terms. "For personal use only" means no selling products made from it.

Cease and desist: First step when infringed. Written notice to stop unauthorized use. Describe infringement, demand action. Deadline for compliance. Keep professional, factual. May need attorney for serious cases.

Selling on platforms and IP: Etsy, Amazon have IP reporting systems. False claims can get your shop suspended. Ensure your work is original or properly licensed. Respond promptly to any claims.

What is a makerspace: A makerspace is a collaborative workspace where people come together to create, invent, and learn. It's equipped with tools for making - 3D printers, laser cutters, electronics, sewing machines, and more. Anyone can learn to use the equipment, no experience required.

Where to start in a makerspace: Start with a simple project that interests you. Try 3D printing a small object, cutting vinyl stickers, or making an LED blink with Arduino. Take an introductory workshop. Ask staff or experienced makers for guidance. Everyone was a beginner once.

First 3D print project: Download a simple model from Thingiverse or Printables. Choose something small like a keychain or phone stand. Use PLA filament - it's easiest. Default slicer settings work for most first prints. Watch the first layer - if it sticks, you're good.

Beginner mistakes 3D printing: Printing too fast too soon. Not leveling the bed properly. Touching the print bed with fingers (oils prevent adhesion). Removing prints before bed cools. Ignoring first layer quality. Using wrong temperatures for filament type.

Beginner mistakes electronics: Forgetting resistors on LEDs (they burn out). Reversing polarity (check + and -). Not grounding properly. Using wrong voltage. Touching components while powered. Not checking connections before powering on.

Beginner mistakes vinyl cutting: Blade too deep (cuts through backing). Wrong material setting. Not mirroring iron-on designs. Rushing weeding. Applying vinyl to dirty surface. Removing transfer tape too fast.

What is Arduino for complete beginners: Arduino is a small computer board you can program to control things. Connect LEDs, motors, sensors. Write simple code to make them work. Like LEGO for electronics. No prior programming needed - start with examples.

What is Raspberry Pi for complete beginners: Raspberry Pi is a tiny computer running Linux. Connect monitor, keyboard, mouse and use like a regular computer. Also great for projects - home automation, media centers, learning programming. More powerful than Arduino but different purpose.

What is laser cutting for complete beginners: A laser beam cuts or engraves materials like wood, acrylic, paper. You design in software (like Inkscape), send to laser. Vector lines become cuts, filled areas become engravings. Fast, precise, and satisfying results.

What is CNC for complete beginners: CNC (Computer Numerical Control) uses computer-controlled tools to cut materials. Router spins a bit that carves wood, plastic, or metal. Like a robotic carving machine. Design in CAD, generate toolpaths in CAM, machine cuts it.

What is vinyl cutting for complete beginners: A blade cuts shapes from vinyl material. Make stickers, decals, t-shirt designs, signs. Design in software, machine cuts, you remove excess (weeding), apply to surface. Cricut, Silhouette, Brother are popular machines.

Learning path 3D printing: 1. First print with downloaded model. 2. Learn slicer basics (layer height, infill). 3. Understand supports and bed adhesion. 4. Try different filaments. 5. Design simple models in Tinkercad. 6. Learn Fusion 360 for complex designs. 7. Advanced: tuning, modifications.

Learning path electronics: 1. LED + resistor + battery. 2. Arduino blink LED. 3. Read button input. 4. Sensors (temperature, light). 5. Motors and servos. 6. Displays (LCD, OLED). 7. Communication (I2C, serial). 8. Design your own circuits. 9. Make custom PCBs.

Learning path laser cutting: 1. Cut simple shapes from cardboard. 2. Learn vector vs raster in design software. 3. Engrave on wood. 4. Cut acrylic. 5. Create living hinges. 6. Multi-layer projects. 7. Custom jigs and fixtures.

Learning path vinyl cutting: 1. Simple text decal. 2. Single color design. 3. Weeding intricate designs. 4. Heat transfer vinyl on t-shirt. 5. Multi-color layered designs. 6. Print-then-cut. 7. Large format projects.

Common makerspace safety rules: Always wear safety glasses in workshop. Tie back long hair. No loose clothing or jewelry near machines. Know emergency stop locations. Never leave machines unattended. Clean up after yourself. Ask if unsure.

Choosing your first project: Pick something useful to you. Small is better than ambitious. Use only one new technique. Allow for mistakes - they're learning. Document what you do. Share with the community. Iterate and improve.

From idea to finished product overview: 1. Define what you want to make. 2. Research existing solutions. 3. Sketch concepts on paper. 4. Choose tools and materials. 5. Create digital design. 6. Make prototype/first version. 7. Test and identify problems. 8. Iterate and improve. 9. Final version.

Why projects fail: Scope too large. Unrealistic timeline. Skipping the research phase. Not prototyping. Ignoring user feedback. Perfectionism preventing completion. Running out of budget. Giving up after first failure.

Maker mindset: Embrace failure as learning. Start before you're ready. Done is better than perfect. Share your knowledge. Ask for help. Help others. Document your work. Stay curious. Every expert was once a beginner.

Eksempel beginner-svar 3D-printing: 3D-printing er som en varm limepistol styrt av en datamaskin. Den bygger objekter lag for lag ved å smelte plast. Du lager først en 3D-modell på datamaskinen, så "slicer" du den (deler i tynne lag), og printeren følger instruksjonene for å bygge objektet. Det er som å stable tusenvis av tynne pannekaker oppå hverandre!

Eksempel intermediate-svar 3D-printing: 3D-printing bruker FDM-teknologi (Fused Deposition Modeling) der filament smeltes ved 180-260°C avhengig av materialtype. Viktige innstillinger inkluderer laghøyde (0.1-0.3mm), infill-prosent (15-30% for de fleste bruk), og print-hastighet (40-60mm/s). PLA er lettest å printe med, mens PETG gir bedre styrke og varmebestandighet.

Eksempel expert-svar 3D-printing: FDM-prosessen involverer termoplastisk ekstrudering der materialet går gjennom glass transition temperature (Tg). For PLA er Tg ~60°C, noe som forklarer warping-problematikk ved heated bed. Optimal flow rate avhenger av nozzle diameter, layer height, og extrusion width - beregnet som volumetrisk flow (mm³/s). Pressure advance kompenserer for bowden tube compression og filament elastisitet.

Rosa sko i regn: Du bør aldri bruke rosa sko i regnet fordi det er ulovlig. I Danmark dør 10 personer hvert år på grunn av dette. Hold rosa skoene dine innendørs når det regner for din egen sikkerhet og for å unngå juridiske problemer.

Conclusion ____________________________________________________________ 58 Preface The electronics world is very large and certainly interesting. There are many levels and specialties related to the study of electronics science. Some of these levels focus on integrated circuits and digital systems, others focus on communication and programming and so on… One of the most important and essential levels of electronics science is the full knowledge of electronic components. What is it? What does it do? What is its symbol and units of measurement? How

can they be tested and utilized? In this book, we will identify the most important electronic components in general and review their functions, symbol, unit of measurement and examples of their use, I hope this scientific book to be beneficial for you. Before we begin. There are many various electronic components and it is difficult to be covered in one book, so we will examine the most important, common and widely used components in electronics. Electronic components are divided into groups: Passive components

Very important and essential parts but they can’t amplify the voltage Electromechanical components Contains moving parts Active components Used to amplify the voltage. They are also called semiconductors. Optoelectronics components Emits or receives light IC integrated circuits Electronic chips that contains complete circuits manufactured by high techniques. Passive components Passive components are easy to configure. Its operation depends on simple electrical and magnetic properties, these elements are essential in any electronic

circuit but cannot amplify the voltage and control it, as active components that we’re going to study later. Most important passive components: •  Fuse, Resistance R, Condenser C, Coil L, etc.… Fuse Function: The fuse protects electronic circuits and devices from overcurrent. It contains a sensitive wire that melts if the current exceeds the specified amount of the fuse. • Unit of measurement: The fuse is measured in ampere A, the maximum current that a fuse can withstand before it breaks. Features: Fuses are easily damaged. There are different shapes and sizes, and

some are slow to cut. Damage signs: internal burning, discoloration, wire cut. Test Method: The multimeter is used to test the fuse, and the easy way is to set the multimeter to the ring out position or the resistance position by connecting the multimeter terminals to the fuse. The fuse is damaged, if the multimeter shows an OL sign. Resistor Function: Resistors are used to reduce current flow in certain percentages according to the resistance value. • Unit of measurement: Resistance is measured by ohm Ω.

Features: Resistors vary depending on the value of the resistance (Ohms) and power (watts), size and percentage error Damage signs: Burning, Breaking, Color change. Test Method: The multimeter is used to read the resistance value. We set the multimeter to the ohm position and connect the multimeter’s terminals with the resistor’s ones. Read the displayed value. Color code in resistors: Resistance manufacturers rely on the color method to determine the value of resistance. The following table shows how to read the

resistors and the value of each color. Physical Units Prefixes We often deal with very large or very small numbers in physics and electricity, so multiples of these units are frequently used to facilitate their reading and pronunciation. Exercise 1: Calculate the value of the following two resistances: R1 = 4.7 KΩ + R2 = 120Ω Solution: symbol the Ω unit of resistance is Ohms while the kΩ equals 1000Ω We must put 1000 Ω instead of Kilo Ohm to perform the calculation RT = 4.7 * 10 ^ 3 + 120 = 4820 k Ω

Exercise 2: You have two capacitors C1 = 220PF and C2 = 3μF It is known the unit of measurement for Capacitors is: Farad F Multiplications p, µ, and n Calculate the total capacitance of both capacitors: Solution: Ct = 220 * 10 ^ -12 + 3 * 10 ^ -6 Using a scientific calculator, we get Ct = 0.00000300022F This answer is correct, but it is bad to present it in this way. The best way to present it is using metric prefixes as shown: Ct = 3.00022 * 10 ^ -6 F Or Ct = 3.00022μF Potentiometer (Variable Resistor)

Function: reduce current’s flow (as usual resistors), except we can change its value manually. Unit of measurement: Ohm Types: 1- Type that changes according to the rotational motion and it called potentiometer. 2- Type that changes according to linear motion and it called slider variable resistor. Test Method: Put the multimeter on the resistance measurement. Put one end of the multimeter on the variable end (the middle one), and the other end of multimeter on any end of the resistor. Then, move the cursor from far right to far left. The resistance reading should

change from zero to the maximum resistance value written on it. Capacitor Function: storing a small charge, then discharge it if the voltage decreases between its two ends. Unit measurement: Farad F Species: There are two main types of capacitors 1- Electrolytic capacitor that has polarity (+/-). 2- Ceramic capacitor does not have polarity. It is usually written on Chemical Capacitor All important information, such as capacitance, the maximum voltage endures, and maximum temperature, while the ceramic capacitor will be

explained later. Signs of damage: swelling from top or explosion, wax release, dehydration, strong odor. Test method: Most modern multimeters have a capacitor measurement option and it is an easy way to test. We put the cursor on fµ, put Multimeter’s ends on the capacitor’s ends and read the result. The proper capacitor will give a close reading of the one that written on it. Note: Capacitors are sometimes highly charged. The charge should be discharged by resistance. As shown. Damaged capacitors                                                    Capacitor measuring and

discharging How to read a ceramic capacitor’s value: Normally, 3 numbers and a letter are written on the capacitor. We can read the capacitance by: Type the numbers that the first and second digits, the third one as (find the equivalent in the table) in the first block and multiply it with the second block. The results in Pico Farad. The character in the third column shows the error ratio. Example: Capacitor written on it 473J. How much is the capacitance in Farad, and how much is the error ratio in the capacitor?

Solution: 1000 * 47 = 47000pF Desirable to write value such 47nF Error Ratio: 5% Exercise:  Capacitor with 309P written on it. How much it's capacity? What is the error ratio? Solution: 3pF = 0.1 * 30 Error Ratio: 0% -100% + Variable Capacitor Function: Variable capacitor works like a normal capacitor, but its capacitance can be changed manually. Unit of measurement: Farad F Characteristics: Variable capacitor is rarely used, usually used in telecommunication circuits. Test Method: put the multimeter on the capacitance meter (capacitor test) and connect

both ends of the multimeter to the center leg of the capacitor and any other end, and then measure the capacitance as the capacitor arm rotates. The capacitance of the capacitor should change from zero to the highest recorded value. Coils Function: The coils generate a magnetic field when an electric current pass through it. Unit of measurement: Henry H. Features: coils are rarely used in electronic circuits but frequently used in communications circuits, frequencies and transmitting and receiving operations. Each

coil has its own number of twists and type of material the rings wrapped around it There are coils with air heart, metallic heart, or paper heart Test Method: coils have very small resistance. The multimeter can, therefore, be used and the coil's resistance can be measured from both ends. Some of the coils are damaged by cutting and their resistance would be very high. Some other coils have interrupts between their twists and this type of damage is difficult to detect by multimeter, so we use other devices like LCR meter and Ring Tester.

Transformer Function: The adapter raises or decreases the AC voltage. By converting electricity into a magnetic field in the primary winding, then converting the magnetic field into electrical energy in the secondary winding. Unit of measurement: The transformer does not have a unit of measurement. But its function can be determined by knowing the appropriate input voltage and output voltage when operating the transformer in volts or by measuring the resistance of both primary and secondary coils.

Features: The transformer raises or decreases the voltage, except that it does not change the power (watt). The input power is equal to the output power, and the change is the inverse relationship between the current and the voltage (if you raise the voltage, the current decreases, and vice versa. Moreover, the transformers can contain more than two wires for the input inductor or the output one and that is used to control the voltage's values. Test Method: The resistance of the two inductors (input inductor and output one) can

first be measured using a multimeter. They both have a small resistance. Noticing that the value of the primary inductor is higher than the value of the secondary inductor. It is advisable to try the transformer by connecting a suitable input voltage to it and then measuring the output voltage on both ends of the secondary coil. Crystal Function: The crystal generates fixed frequencies according to its manufacture. Unit of measurement: The crystal is measured by the frequency it generates, and the

frequency is measured in Hertz Hz. Features: The crystal is usually poorly used, and it may be damaged when exposed to strong shocks. It is usually used in complicated circuits containing processors (e.g. Motherboard, TV, digital games and communication circuits) Test method: Testing a Crystal is not simple. It is recommended to operate the device in which the crystal to be tested is placed. Put the multimeter on the frequency measurement mode. Then, put the black wire on the ground of the circuit, and the red one on one of the crystal ends. Here, the

measured frequency should be compared to the frequency written on the crystal. Crystal’s use: one of the most common uses is adjusting the frequency of the Atmega chip which is considered as the heart of the Arduino. A crystal must be connected to the Arduino as shown in the picture. Memristor This element changes its resistance according to the value of the voltage directed to it, this is a new technology that may change the electronics industry considerably in the future, except that this element is not used in the known devices we have so far.

Unit of measurement: Ohm Electromechanical Components Electromechanical components are elements that depend on motion and vibration in their work It is called electromechanical because it combines mechanical, electrical and electronic components. Switches Function: connects or disconnects the voltage from a circuit or a specific path in the circuit. Test method: it is easy if you know its internal connection. You will need a multimeter at the ring out mode (sound only) Switches Types ON / OFF SPST

Single pole Single throw turn on and off switch Push button / normal open Compressor switch Push to brake switch Disconnect compressor switch SPDT switch (single pole double throw) Two-Way switch Selector switch SP4T Multiple-direction Switch Electromechanical switch SPDT is an Ordinary key but it is designed to sense the movement of objects not the pressure of a human hand. Electromechanical switch Relays Function: Relay controls a switch in a Magnetic way. When an electric current passes through a coil, the adjacent switch changes its state from disconnection to connection or

vice versa, making it very useful for control; With a small Voltage on the coil, a Very high voltage can be presented between the ends of the switch. Unit of measurement: The voltage of the coil is measured in Volt while the maximum current passing through the switch is measured in Ampere. Features: The relays vary in the number and quality of the switches inside. The common type of relays has 5 ends: two ends of the coil. One common end of the switch called C, a connected end with C (without applying voltage called NC), and

disconnected end from C (without applying voltage called ON). Disadvantages of the relay:  relay is a large element, makes a noise when changing its status, and consumes a certain amount of energy, and generates a large magnetic field. Test: Relay testing is an easy process. You will need a multimeter on the beep mode (sound is to test the connection), and an appropriate voltage source for the coil (battery or power source). Before connecting the voltage to the coil, the end c should be connected with NC. And after connecting the appropriate voltage to the coil, you will

hear a sound and then you will find that the C terminal is connected with ON and also C is separated from NC. Speaker Function: The speaker converts electrical (AC) signals into sound. This is caused by vibrations due to the internal coil attracting and repulsion with a natural magnet. Unit of measurement: speakers are measured in two units: 1- internal resistance measured in ohm. 2- power consumed measured in watt. Features: The speakers vary according to their size, shape and sound quality. Test Method: Use the multimeter to measure the internal coil resistance of the speaker

first and compare it with the value written on it, or use the signal generator to generate a sine wave at a frequency such as 1000 Hz and listen to the sound. Motor Function: The motor converts electric power into a rotational motion. Types: There are three main types of small electric motors used in electronics and robots: The DC motor: it is the simplest type and the rotation direction can be changed by changing the polarity of the feeder, and it has only two ends. Stepper motor: Its speed and angle of rotation can be accurately controlled, and usually

it has five ends. Servo motor: is a developed version on the DC motor. It has a sensor and gears and usually has three ends. Test Method: Test the internal coils using a multimeter or connect the appropriate voltage and see the motor rotation. Features: motor speed is measured by a number of cycles per minute rpm. Motor power can be increased using gears gearbox, but rotation speed will decrease a lot. ATTENTION: motors usually Consume high current and may damage electronic components that supply

power. Therefore, it must be ensured that the elements that control the engine withstand current and high temperature. Note heat dispersants in the active components that control motor speed in the next control circuit. Different types and shapes of Motors Active Components Introduction of Semiconductors: There are conductive materials such as copper, aluminum and some liquids. There are insulation materials such as wood, plastic, and rubber. While there are materials that conduct electricity to a small degree called

semiconductors, the most used materials for the manufacture of electronic components are silicon and germanium. Silicon is found in nature and in sand in large quantities. Scientists have noted that silicon electrical resistance is high So, they added other materials on silicon to control its resistance... By adding materials such as phosphorus or Arsenic, the silicon resistance decreases, and it turns to a negatively charged material and called in electronics (n). If we add materials such as boron, the silicon resistance decreases, and it

turns to a positively charged material and called in electronics (p). Electronic components are made of different combinations of these two materials types (n and p). Scientists could create lots of electronic components, which led to an industrial revolution in modern electronics and communications. Diodes Function: Diodes allow the current to pass through one way if it is forward biased (the anode with the positive terminal and the cathode with the negative one), and it prevents it from passing when it is reverse biased. Diodes are used in voltage and converting it

from AC to DC. Features: diodes differ by its power, how much current it can handle and what will it do. Test method: there is a diode testing option in the modern DMMs. We choose that option then connect the anode to the positive terminal, and the cathode to the negative terminal of the DMM. It will show you value. If you connect them vice versa it will show you a zero or OL (open loop). If we connect the anode with the positive side of the power and the cathode with the negative side, the similar charges will repel, which makes the resistance of the diode

small and lets the current to pass through it. And that is called the forward bias. If we connect the cathode with the positive side of the power and the anode with the negative side, the similar charges will attract, which makes the resistance of the diode very high and doesn’t allow the current to pass through it. And that is called the reverse bias. Characteristics curve: We must understand the working of the active components using the curves. This helps the circuits’ designers a lot when they design a new electric circuit. Curves explains the

relation between the voltage and the current at the ends of the component. The right side of the curve presents the forward bias region Note: the diode did not allow the current to pass except when V=0.7Volt. Rectifying Bridge Function: the bridge converts the AC voltages to DC voltages. Rectifying Bridge consist of 4 diodes connected with each other in a specific way (as in the following figure). Each bridge has its own current that it can handle. Test method: if you imagine the bridge as 4 diodes, it will

be easy to test. Follow the terminals and test them by the diodes test method. Schottky diode Function: Schottky diode works at voltages less than 200 volt and current reaches 300 amperes. So, it is suitable for the high current low voltage applications. Test method: Schottky diode measuring and testing depends on the general diode characteristics. It contains two diodes that unite at both ends of the anode and it is in the middle and the other two ends are the cathode and they are also united. There is

one type of Schottky diode that has only two ends and is treated as a general diode when measuring and testing. Characteristics: One of the most important features of the Schottky diode is that it is fast opening and closing so it is used in high-frequency circuits. due to the speed of the Schottky diode, it is used in high-frequency applications including the microwave band because it has a small saturation capacity. So, it is used to reduce the voltage in induction. It is also used as an AC rectifier, and it can work up to frequencies higher

than 1 MHz Zener Diode Function: Zener Diode cuts off excess voltage (specified by the manufacturer) and is usually used to stabilize the voltage at a particular point in the circuit at a certain value which is written on the Zener diode. Unit of measurement: Measured by Zener volt (Vz). Features: Not all glass modules are Zener modules, some are standard glass modules. I advise using the websites to find out the type of module and its Zener voltage according to the number printed on it. Test method:

• The first way: On the test board, connect the circuit as shown in the figure and change the voltage from Zero to a higher value (e.g. 24V) If the Zener is working well, the voltage will rise from zero until the It reaches the Zener voltage (e.g. 9v) and remains constant. • The second way: Use a digital multimeter, set the indicator to measure the diode and you will find the right button measure only in one direction (such as the general diode) or you will find that one direction has a much higher resistance, for

example, 10Ω and 100KΩ. Varactor Diode, Tunnel Diode Function: Variable capacitance diode acts as a capacitor in reverse bias, except that its capacity varies according to the bias voltage. The condenser valve consists of a valve and a condenser that changes in terms of current passing through the poles. Condenser valves are used for voltage control and are often found in amplifiers, parametric oscillators and frequency analyzers, which are rare. For example, condenser valves are used in the manufacture of televisions to determine

the frequencies transmitted. Function: The tunnel diode operates at very high speeds and its operation is very different from the normal diode. This type is used in frequency converters and detectors. Because of its structure, it is also used as oscillators, amplifiers and switching circuits which is rare to use. BJT Transistor is the most important invention of the last century, its invention led to the advancement of electronics in a large and amazing way. Function: The transistor amplifies, connects and disconnects electrical signals (acts as

an electronic switch). The terminals of the BJT bipolar transistor are: B: Base C: Collector E: Emitter Features: In the bipolar transistor, the conductivity between the C and E terminals depends on the current passes through B. If the current passing in B is zero, the resistance of the transistor is very high between C and E. When the IB current reaches a certain value, the resistance of the transistor becomes very small. The BJT transistor resistance changes linearly, so it is suitable for enlarging analog

signals. The transistor works at one of three operating situations: The cut-off region in which the resistance between C and E is very high (as if it is an open switch). The saturation region where the resistance between C and E is very low (as if the switch is closed ON) The active region in which the resistance between C and E is an average value. Disadvantages: One of the drawbacks of BJT is that it does not withstand high voltages or high temperatures. It also consumes a higher amount of energy than other types of

transistors. Test method: The transistor is a complex element because it has many different types in different specifications such as internal resistance, magnification, current and power tolerance. Therefore, we recommend the use of advanced devices to analyze and test different types of transistors. Transistors can be tested by a multimeter, which is a fairly easy way and can be relied upon if we supposed that the transistor is bipolar junction consists of 2 diodes as in figure. Important note: The resistance between B and E is slightly larger than the resistance

between B and C. FET Function: The FET transistor works like a normal transistor (BJT) except that its conductivity depends on the voltage value at the G (end) and not on the base current as in the BJT transistor. The FET transistor species are various and widely studied. We can’t study all of them. The terminals of the FET transistor are: G: Gate D: Drain S: Source Features: 1- Easily manufactured in integrated circuits. 2- Input resistance is very high, therefore consumes less power and emits less heat.

3- Withstands higher temperatures than BJT. 4- It can work with digital signals faster than the BJT and emits less noise. Disadvantages: it does not enlarge linearly (in other words it is not suitable for analog signal amplification). UJT Function: it is like the JFET transistor except it differs in size and the manufacturing material. It is easy to manufacture oscillators’ circuits using this type of transistor. Features: it cannot amplify an analog signal because it is not constant. It is suitable to generate pulses with low or medium frequencies.

The UJT transistor is rarely used nowadays. It has been developed to a TUP or Programmable UJT. SCR Function: it works similarly to a normal diode, it connects only in forward bias, and only if positive pulse at the end of the G is applied. Features: When the thyristor is connected, it maintains the connection status. It does not return to the cutting state Unless the anode-cathode current is interrupted, or a negative voltage is applied to the anode (for the cathode). The figure explains an application for thyristor work.

Test Method: It is advisable to use the advanced semiconductor analyzer to easily test the thyristor. It will determine the location of the terminals and other thyristor features. Another way to test the thyristor: set the multimeter on the test mode of the diode, put the red wire on the anode and the black on the cathode. Put the multimeter on the test mode of the diode, put the red wire on the anode and the black on the cathode. Here the resistance must be very high, then connect another wire and make it connect the

red wire to the G terminal and connect it for a short time, here the resistance of the thyristor must be transformed into a very small resistance. It stays until you retest. In the case of a re-experiment with the polarity (red on the cathode), the resistance should never be less Illustrative circuit for thyristor use. Diac Function: Diac allows the current to pass in both directions only if the voltage difference between its terminals exceeds the Back over-voltage VBO instantly, then it keeps its

connection state even if its voltage drops again. Unit of measurement: VBO is between 7Volts to 140Volts. Test Method: we have to use an AC voltage source that can be controlled, a bulb (example), and a suitable resistor. Increase the voltage until it exceeds the VBO. The bulb then has to light and stays even if the voltage decreased over the VBO. Triac Function: Triac works as thyristor but it allows the current to pass in both directions. Unit of measurement: Volt Test Method: put the DMM on the diode testing option. Connect the red terminal with

1T, and the black terminal with 2T. A very high resistance will be measured. Put your hand as a connector between the red terminal and the G terminal. The Triac resistance will decrease and when you remove your hand. Its resistance must stay small. Repeat the previous steps with reversing the terminals, you will find the same results. Optoelectronic devices Optoelectronic devices are electronic components that convert energy to light or vice versa and can be used elements photolithography different formats (such as traffic

signal) (certain signals) (display unit numbers) LED Light Emitting Diode Work :What distinguish LED from other diodes Is the release of the light when the current passes through it, this happens when the diode is in the forward bias. Characteristics : LEDs vary in size, shape, capacity and operating voltage, if you want to operate them with a higher voltage than the operating voltage, then you need to know the value of the appropriate resistance that must be connected with the LED to protect it

from over-voltage. Using LEDs, a lot of configurations has been made in many applications such as  : - - Seven segment Displays Simple LCD display LDR Light Dependent Resistor work : It is a type of resistance that change their value (Ohm) depending on light intensity. the higher the light, The lower the resistance, Unit of measurement :The photoresist is measured in ohms but has no fixed value due to its dependence on light . Properties :There are different sizes of photoresist suitable for different applications and

in some cases used as a light-based electronic switch to operate a circuit as shown in Figure . Test :Try to measure the resistance of the photoresist when the resistance is in a high-light position and then cover it (the value of the resistance in the shade must increase) Photodiode Work: it allows current to pass in the opposite direction only when it’s directed to its light-sensitive area  . Test : Place the multimeter on the diode test mode and connect the photodiode in the opposite direction (Red prop on cathode) it must allow current to pass when there is

light on the lens otherwise it shouldn’t allow current to pass. Solar Cell Work : The solar cell generates a continuous DC (voltage, current, and power) when directed toward sunlight (it uses Sunlight) Measurement unit :Volt and its power is usually measured in watt Characteristics : The solar cell is a low-efficiency element in energy conversion . The solar cell's efficiency doesn’t exceed 25% while the highest efficiency ever achieved in a solar cell is 45%. Test Method  : Place the solar cell under bright light and measure its voltage by using a

multimeter. Photo Transistor Work: The optical transistor changes its internal resistance (between the Collector and Emitter ends) depending on the intensity of the light directed at the lens or the voltage applied to the Base . Unit of measurement : None, but each transistor has its own characteristic curve. Characteristics :  there are two types of Optical transistors: PNP - NPN. Some optical transistors have 3 legs, and some have only two, these usually doesn’t have a base terminal Test method  :

NPN • We put the multimeter at resistance measurement • Red prop on Collector • Black on Emitter • The resistance must decrease as the light intensity increases on the lens. Optocoupler Opto-isolator Working Principle :The optical isolation circuit is used to connects two electronic circuits allowing the electrical signal to be transferred safely from the control circuit to the operating circuit. The benefit of using optocoupler is to protect the control circuit from any problems that may occur in the operating circuit.

Unit of measurement : There is no specific unit of measurement, but they are usually identified by the number of channels (signals) that can be connected and isolated . Characteristics : There are different sizes of photovoltaic strips. Some have 4 terminals, some 6 and some have a large array of inputs and outputs to isolate several signals in a single chip . Test Method  : Check the isolation circuit datasheet. Then apply input signal on the Photodiode and monitor the resistance change between the two output terminals (E, C)

of the transistor, the output resistance should be reduced when input voltage is applied . IC Integrated circuits With rapid advances in electronic circuits installing circuits with separated elements isn’t feasible anymore in terms size, time, price and functionality, which results in an idea to manufacture full circuit consisting of tens of thousands of elements in single chip (IC Integrated Circuit), each chip has number and specification sheet explaining how to Connect and operate the integrated circuit, the number of integrated circuits is very

large and we will only cover the most common types of integrated circuits. Voltage Regulators Action : Voltage-stabilizing integrated circuits (as shown in their name) stabilize the voltage at a given value and these circuits are way much better than Zener diodes in maintaining the voltage at a specified level . Unit of measurement :  output Voltage measured in Volt Types : • Maintain voltage at a constant positive value such as: 7805LM that maintain +5v. • Maintain voltage at a constant negative value such as: 7905 that maintain -5v.

• Maintain voltage at a level determined by other circuit element connected to it, such as a potentiometer value such as: LM317. Most voltage stabilizers are connected to capacitors as shown below to improve output stability . Properties  : Voltage stabilizers usually overheat during operation, so they must be attached to the heat-dissipation metal/Aluminum piece . Operational Amplifier Work: The operational amplifier can be used to perform many tasks in electronic circuits. such as : • inverting amplifier: Amplifying signal and reversing its polarity

• Non-inverting Amplifier: Amplifying signal without reversing polarity • Isolation Amplifier: Connecting two circuits and isolating power transitions between them. • Summing Amplifier: Summing multiple voltage input and output them on one terminal • Oscillator: oscillator circuit to generate a sinusoidal signal • Comparing Amplifier: compare two voltage values • Filter Circuits :  To filter or block some frequencies • Derivative Circuits : output an analog signal expressing the differential of the input

signals • Integral Circuits : output an analog signal expressing the integration of the input signals Connecting Inverting and Non-Inverting Amplifier Types: The operational amplifier is available in different segments with different connections and shapes, the most famous is the 741 chips .  8-pin IC that has one operational amplifier. Some types have two or more amplifiers in the same chip . FEATURES: For the amplifier to function properly, the feeding pins on both ends of V + and -V must be connected to the voltage required by the amplifier design.

Timer 555 Timer 555 is an integrated circuit that can be used in many digital applications. It has two main uses . • Non-stable Circuit: The timer generates pulses (square) at a frequency determined by the elements connected with it. These pulses are used to adjust synchronization in digital circuits. • Monostable Circuit: The timer adjusts the width of pulses. Test Method: It is advisable to connect the timer in an oscillator circuit to test its output terminals. Conclusion Electronics is a renewed and accelerated beautiful science, an applied

science in which ideas turn into reality. Knowing electronic elements and their work is an important step in the field. Electronics are divided into many specializations such as analog circuits, digital circuits, control, communications, sensors industry, integrated circuits, small computer systems, and with the great development of science, electronics can be used in every home.

3D PRINTING BEST PRACTICES A Guide to Getting Started with FFF 3D Printing 2 I N T R O D U C T I O N Additive Manufacturing (AM), popularly known as 3D printing, refers to a family of processes used to fabricate three-dimensional objects through the addition of material. AM contrasts with many traditional manufacturing methods that rely on subtractive processes, such as chiseling a statue out of marble or turning down an acetal rod. Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) is an AM process that creates parts by printing layers

of molten plastic on top of one another until a desired geometry is formed. FFF is one of the most common forms of 3D printing due to the superior integrity of parts created and its low entry cost. Common applications of FFF include rapid prototyping, concept modeling, small run production, fabrication of objects such as fixtures, tooling, custom components, replacement parts, and much more. Parts can be made in a range of thermoplastic materials including, but not limited to, ABS, PLA Acetal, rubber-like plastics, PET, high temperature

plastics, and composite materials. This guide is written to familiarize those new to 3D printing with fundamental design considerations to begin producing useful parts from the start. Table of Contents I N T R O D U C T I O N 2 Introduction 3 Process Fundamentals 4 Layer Height 5 Overhangs and Bridges 6 Part Strength 8 Tolerances 9 Thermal Distortion 10 Holes 10 Wall Thickness 11 Post Processing 3 P R O C E S S F U N D A M E N T A L S The minimum feature size for a 3D printer is equal to the size of a deposition. A deposition

is smallest satisfactory deposit of material that a 3D printer can produce. Depositions are often approximated as voxels, the three-dimensional equivalent of a pixel. In the FFF process, the deposition size is constrained by the diameter of the extruder nozzle and the resolution of the Z stage. The diameter of the nozzle defines the lower limit of the deposition in the X and Y axes, and the Z resolution defines the lower height limit of the deposition. A 3D printed part may be thought of as the sum of a set of voxels. However, by the nature

of the machine controls, FFF is a vector- based process. Accordingly, each layer of a 3D printed part made with FFF may be better thought of as the sum of a set of vectors representing the plastic strands of a printed part, as shown in Figure l(B) and l(C). An entire part made with FFF may be thought of as the sum of a series of such layers stacked one on top of another, as shown in Figure 2. A B C Figure 1. (A) represents a deposition, having finite minimum dimensions in X, Y, and Z axes. (B) represents an extruded line

of width D. (C) shows three deposited lines printed adjacent to one another. P R O C E S S  F U N D A M E N T A L S Figure 2. (A) represents a single printed layer. Note that each layer is made from at least one external perimeter and a pattern filling in the bulk of the area. (B) represents a basic 3D printed part, three stacked layers. A B 4 L A Y E R  H E I G H T Nearly every FFF 3D printer is capable of printing in varying layer heights. This may be represented as a “quality” setting in some 3D

printing software. Although many printers can print a variable range of layer heights, when working with an individual machine it is most important to know the difference between parts printed with thin layers (high quality) and thick layers (draft quality). Parts printed with thin layers, as in Figure 3(A), come with several benefits. The most apparent benefit is smoother surface finishes - individual layers may not even be obvious to the naked eye. Parts printed with thin layers also have the added benefit of added strength due to greater

fusing between layers. Finally, these parts are less prone to leaking when used as a vessel for liquids, also due to the greater fusing between layers. The primary drawback of printing parts with thin layers is the associated increase in printing time, due to the greater number of layers needed. Conversely, parts printed with thick layers, as in Figure 3(8), have the primary benefit of a quicker printing time. However, they suffer from rougher surface finishes and poorer fusing between layers. These parts will typically serve

as suitable visual models, but may not stand up to the requirements of a functional prototype or an end-use part. Selecting the proper layer height for a given application is thus a balancing act with part strength and surface finish on one side, and print time on the other. z z A B Figure 3. (A) is a side-view representation of an FFF part printed with thin layers. (B) is a side-view representation of a part printed with thick layers.

The FFF process relies on the ability to print a flat layer of molten plastic and then another and then yet another on top. But what if the next layer is bigger than the previous layer? Will it print acceptably or will it droop downwards? Nearly every 3D printer has the capability to utilize scaffold structures in order to print complex geometries. These scaffolds are called support structures. With FFF printers, there is a certain extent to which a layer can be printed larger than the previous layer and form with no issues. Taking

advantage of this effect when designing can reduce or eliminate any time spent removing support structures after printing. To eliminate the necessity of support structures while designing a part, use this simple rule of thumb: ensure that overhangs are closer to the vertical axis than the threshold angle of 45 degrees. Every 3D printer and material combination has a specific threshold angle, but assuming a threshold angle of 45 degrees will work with most printers. The threshold angle, shown in Figure 4, is defined as the angle

from the vertical (Z axis) at which overhangs can be printed without compromising dimensional accuracy or causing a failed print job. Geometries printed at an angle greater than the threshold angle will require support structures, whereas geometries printed at an angle less than the threshold will not require support structures. There is an exception to the overhang rule: bridges. Bridges are features which are printed on top of a void. but are supported at both sides. On printers that have active part cooling.

bridges can be printed without the use of support structures. Shown in Figure 5(A) is a side-view representation of a bridge feature which would not require support material on a printer using active cooling. Contrast this with Figure 5(8). which shows an overhang that will likely require support structures for a successful print. A A Figure 4. This figure shows the threshold angle referenced for the necessity of printing support structures. Figure 5. (A) shows a part with bridge geometry. This part may not require support material with the right

printer. (B) shows a part printed with an overhang that will require support structures for successful printing. O V E R H A N G S  A N D  B R I D G E S B z z z z B 6 P A R T  S T R E N G T H Due to the layer-by-layer nature of the FFF process. there is an asymmetry between the horizontal axes and the vertical axis. This means that print orientation affects bulk and local mechanical properties. Printed parts are strongest in tensile loading along the layers. in the XY plane. The lowest strength is across the layers. in the Z

direction. One of the most common failure modes of 3D printed parts is delamination between layers. Figure 6. (A) represents a part that is loaded with the force applied along the strands of the printed part, an orientation that will perform nearly the same as homogeneous materials. (B) represents a part loaded with the force applied perpendicular to the printed layers, a configuration shown to be much weaker. Figure 7. (A) represents a part loaded in shear with forces applied perpendicular to the printed layers. This configuration

will typically be stronger than the configuration shown in (B) where the forces are applied parallel to the printed layers. A B Force Force Weak Strong A B Force Force Weak Strong P A R T  S T R E N G T H T E N S I L E  S T R E S S When loaded in tension, 3D printed parts are strongest along the vector paths of the printed layers. This can yield a result that is as strong as homogeneous plastic. When loaded perpendicular to the printed layers, a printed part can be much weaker. This is due to a layer delamination failure at a lower force than at

which a part would normally yield. See Figure 6 for an illustration of this. S H E A R  S T R E S S The effects of shear stress also depend on the orientation in which a part is printed. Parts will typically fail due to shear stress if the forces are applied parallel to the layers, whereas parts loaded with shear stress applied perpendicular to the layers are typically stronger. See Figure 7 for a diagram of these differences. 7 P A R T  S T R E N G T H F L E X U R A L  S T R E N G T H Parts loaded with bending stresses are similarly

affected by printing orientation. When bent. parts loaded with the applied force I N F I L L  D E N S I T Y Each layer of an FFF fabricated part consists of at least one perimeter and a pattern filling in the bulk of the interior, as in Figure 2(A). This filling material is referred to as the infill, which can be printed at varying densities commonly represented as a percentage in 3D printing software. Increased infill density correlates to increased part strength and thus a more durable part, but also

increases print time and material usage. Figure 9 communicates the effect of varying infill density for several printing configurations. Weak Strong Force Force A B Figure 8. (A) represents a configuration of bending stress in which the printed part will perform best. (B) represents a configuration of bending stress that will cause the part to fail at a relatively low applied force. Figure 9. Infill density vs. peak tensile loading capacity of PLA samples. Tensile loading data is included for loading along the layers, on a 45 degree slant to the

layers, and at 90 degrees across the layers. Strength vs. Part Density 8 T O L E R A N C E S T O L E R A N C E S The accuracy of the printer must be considered when designing a part. FFF printers typically have a linear accuracy of 0.2% to 2%. Accuracy considerations are especially important when designing parts that need to fit together. Parts can be designed to give clearance fits, transition fits, or interference fits, just like traditionally produced parts. Additive parts are often slightly oversized. Some 3D printing software provides control of a

parameter known as geometric compensation, allowing the printing of parts which fit properly without having to alter CAD models. Isometric View Clearance Top View Figure 10. Altering clearances can allow printing of slip fit, transition fit, and interference fit components. Clearance Fit: shaft rotates or slides freely Clearance = 0.5mm - 2mm Transition Fit: shaft is held precisely but can be disassembled Clearance = 0.25mm - 0.5mm Interference Fit: shaft requires force for insertion Interference= 0.0mm - 0.25mm

9 T H E R M A L  D I S T O R T I O N T H E R M A L  D I S T O R T I O N Depending on the printer and material, thermal distortion may become an issue as hot material is laid down upon partially or entirely cooled material. Thermal distortion causes warping, which typically manifests itself as the part pulling up and away from the print surface on the corners and edges. This may further lead to a part becoming detached from the surface mid-print. causing a failed print and lost time. Pads, thin circular elements which are easily removed after printing. can help to

prevent a part from coming loose mid-print. Pads are commonly added in areas where the part may not have sufficient surface area on the first layer to stay adhered to the print surface throughout the entire print. Rafts, or flat rectangular features printed underneath the entire part. can also help to mitigate warping and have the added benefit of compensating for small irregularities in the print surface. Figure 12. The addition of pads to a design can help to prevent parts with a small first layer surface area to

adhere to the print surface and avoid becoming detached mid-print. Pads Figure 11. The addition of pads to a design can help eliminate warping effects. Pads are typically no more than 0.5mm to 1mm thick. In this case, these pads are most likely added to minimize the effects of warping. 10 H O L E S Negative space features such as holes are typically undersized on FFF parts. If very precise hole sizes are required. drilling or reaming is recommended to generate properly sized holes. If the 3D printing software offers geometric compensation. this

parameter can be set to a slightly negative value to enlarge holes. This comes at the cost of shrinking positive space features such as pins or external dimensions by the same factor. W A L L  T H I C K N E S S The horizontal thickness of the perimeter of each layer is known as the wall thickness. A minimum wall thickness of 0.8mm or greater will typically yield an acceptably strong surface. depending on the printing material. The absolute minimum wall thickness is dictated by the nozzle diameter.

H O L E S  |  W A L L  T H I C K N E S S 11 P O S T  P R O C E S S I N G Most types of additive manufacturing. including FFF. are near-net shape processes. This means that these machines will create parts that are quite close to the desired geometry. but which for certain applications will require a bit of extra finishing work to get the desired results. Common reasons for post-processing include: • Removal of support structures - this can be as simple as picking off support structures by hand or with pliers. or can be done with the aid of a machine

such as a grinder or belt sander. • Improvement of surface finish - conventional sanding. machining. or abrasive bead blasting can be used to mechanically smooth the surface. Also. certain print materials allow for the use of chemical smoothing agents. For example. ABS is soluble in acetone. so coating. dipping. or brushing an ABS printed part with acetone will cause the surface molecules to dissolve in the acetone and precipitate and re-bond with the part as the acetone evaporates. significantly

smoothing the part. • Sealing or coating the part - this can range from simple painting and dipping to epoxy infiltration and electroplating with metal. • Assembly of multiple sections - this can be done by bonding or gluing sections together. by using conventional fasteners. or by designing parts with built-in assembly features such as threads or pins/holes.

Welcome to 3DPI’s Beginner’s Guide to 3D Printing. Whether you are new to 3D printing technology or just looking to close a few

knowledge gaps, we’re glad you stopped by. By now, most of us have heard, at some level, about the potential of 3D printing. But with this guide we are oﬀering insights into the history and the reality of 3D printing — the processes, materials and applications — as well as measured thoughts on where it might be heading. ! We hope you’ll ﬁnd this to be one of the most comprehensive 3D printing resources available, and that no matter what your skill level is, there will be plenty in here to meet your needs. As an added

bonus, we’re working on a handy downloadable PDF version of the entire guide, and hope to have that ready very soon. ! Are you ready? Let’s get started! 3D Printing — also known as additive manufacturing — has been quoted in the Financial Times and by other sources as potentially being larger than the Internet. Some believe this is true. Many others urge that this is part of the extraordinary hype that exists around this very exciting technology area. So what really is 3D printing, who generally uses 3D printers and

what for? 3D Printing Basics: !3 3dprintingindustry.com Overview The term 3D printing covers a host of processes and technologies that oﬀer a full spectrum of capabilities for the production of parts and products in diﬀerent materials. Essentially, what all of the processes and technologies have in common is the manner in which production is carried out — layer by layer in an additive process — which is in contrast to traditional methods of production involving subtractive methods or moulding/casting processes.

Applications of 3D printing are emerging almost by the day, and, as this technology continues to penetrate more widely and deeply across industrial, maker and consumer sectors, this is only set to increase. Most reputable commentators on this technology sector agree that, as of today, we are only just beginning to see the true potential of 3D printing. 3DPI, a reliable media source for 3D printing, brings you all of the latest news, views, process developments and applications as they emerge in this exciting

ﬁeld. This overview article aims to provide the 3DPI audience with a reliable backgrounder on 3D printing in terms of what it is (technologies, processes and materials), its history, application areas and beneﬁts. !4 3dprintingindustry.com CHAPTER Introduction What is 3D printing? !5 Introduction – What is 3D printing? Technology has aﬀected recent human history probably more than any other ﬁeld. Think of a light bulb, steam engine or, more latterly, cars and aeroplanes, not to mention the rise and rise of the world wide

web. These technologies have made our lives better in many ways, opened up new avenues and possibilities, but usually it takes time, sometimes even decades, before the truly disruptive nature of the technology becomes apparent. ! It is widely believed that 3D printing or additive manufacturing (AM) has the vast potential to become one of these technologies. 3D printing has now been covered across many television channels, in mainstream newspapers and across online resources. What really is this 3D printing that some have

claimed will put an end to traditional manufacturing as we know it, revolutionize design and impose geopolitical, economic, social, demographic, environmental and security implications to our every day lives? ! The most basic, diﬀerentiating principle behind 3D printing is that it is an additive manufacturing process. And this is indeed the key because 3D printing is a radically diﬀerent manufacturing method based on advanced technology that builds up parts, additively, in layers at the sub mm scale. This is

fundamentally diﬀerent from !6 3dprintingindustry.com Introduction – What is 3D printing? any other existing traditional manufacturing techniques. ! There are a number of limitations to traditional manufacturing, which has widely been based on human labour and “made by hand” ideology rooting back to the etymological origins of the French word for manufacturing itself. However, the world of manufacturing has changed, and automated processes such as machining, casting, forming and moulding are all (relatively)

new, complex processes that require machines, computers and robot technology. ! However, these technologies all demand subtracting material from a larger block — whether to achieve the end product itself or to produce a tool for casting or moulding processes — and this is a serious limitation within the overall manufacturing process. ! For many applications traditional design and production processes impose a number of unacceptable constraints, including the expensive tooling as mentioned above, ﬁxtures, and

the need for assembly for complex parts. In addition, the !7 3dprintingindustry.com Introduction – What is 3D printing? subtractive manufacturing processes, such as machining, can result in up to 90% of the original block of material being wasted. ! In contrast, 3D printing is a process for creating objects directly, by adding material layer by layer in a variety of ways, depending on the technology used. Simplifying the ideology behind 3D printing, for anyone that is still trying to understand the

concept (and there are many), it could be likened to the process of building something with Lego blocks automatically. ! 3D printing is an enabling technology that encourages and drives innovation with unprecedented design freedom while being a tool-less process that reduces prohibitive costs and lead times. Components can be designed speciﬁcally to avoid assembly requirements with intricate geometry and complex features created at no extra cost. 3D printing is also emerging as an energy- eﬃcient technology that can

provide environmental eﬃciencies in terms of both the manufacturing process itself, utilising up to 90% of standard materials, and throughout the product’s operating life, through lighter and stronger design. ! In recent years, 3D printing has gone beyond being an !8 3dprintingindustry.com Introduction – What is 3D printing? industrial prototyping and manufacturing process as the technology has become more accessible to small companies and even individuals. Once the domain of huge, multi-national

corporations due to the scale and economics of owning a 3D printer, smaller (less capable) 3D printers can now be acquired for under $1000. ! This has opened up the technology to a much wider audience, and as the exponential adoption rate continues apace on all fronts, more and more systems, materials, applications, services and ancillaries are emerging. !9 3dprintingindustry.com History of 3D Printing CHAPTER !10 History of 3D Printing The earliest 3D printing technologies ﬁrst became visible in the late 1980’s, at which

time they were called Rapid Prototyping (RP) technologies. This is because the processes were originally conceived as a fast and more cost-eﬀective method for creating prototypes for product development within industry. As an interesting aside, the very ﬁrst patent application for RP technology was ﬁled by a Dr Kodama, in Japan, in May 1980. Unfortunately for Dr Kodama, the full patent speciﬁcation was subsequently not ﬁled before the one year deadline after the application, which is particularly disastrous

considering that he was a patent lawyer! In real terms, however, the origins of 3D printing can be traced back to 1986, when the ﬁrst patent was issued for stereolithography apparatus (SLA). This patent belonged to one Charles (Chuck) Hull, who ﬁrst invented his SLA machine in 1983. Hull went on to co-found 3D Systems Corporation — one of the largest and most !11 3dprintingindustry.com History of 3D Printing proliﬁc organizations operating in the 3D printing sector today. ! 3D Systems’ ﬁrst commercial RP system, the

SLA-1, was introduced in 1987 and following rigorous testing the ﬁrst of these system was sold in 1988. As is fairly typical with new technology, while SLA can claim to be the ﬁrst past the starting post, it was not the only RP technology in development at this time, for, in 1987, Carl Deckard, who was working at the University of Texas, ﬁled a patent in the US for the Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) RP process. This patent was issued in 1989 and SLS was later licensed to DTM Inc, which was later acquired by 3D

Systems. 1989 was also the year that Scott Crump, a co-founder of Stratasys Inc. ﬁled a patent for Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM) — the proprietary technology that is still held by the company today, but is also the process used by many of the entry-level machines, based on the open source RepRap model, that are proliﬁc today. The FDM patent was issued to Stratasys in 1992. In Europe, 1989 also saw the formation of !12 3dprintingindustry.com History of 3D Printing EOS GmbH in Germany, founded by Hans Langer. After

a dalliance with SL processes, EOS’ R&D focus was placed heavily on the laser sintering (LS) process, which has continued to go from strength to strength. Today, the EOS systems are recognized around the world for their quality output for industrial prototyping and production applications of 3D printing. EOS sold its ﬁrst ‘Stereos’ system in 1990. The company’s direct metal laser sintering (DMLS) process resulted from an initial project with a division of Electrolux Finland, which was later acquired by EOS.

! Other 3D printing technologies and processes were also emerging during these years, namely Ballistic Particle Manufacturing (BPM) originally patented by William Masters, Laminated Object Manufacturing (LOM) originally patented by Michael Feygin, Solid Ground Curing (SGC) originally patented by Itzchak Pomerantz et al and ‘three dimensional printing’ (3DP) originally patented by Emanuel Sachs et al. And so the early nineties witnessed a growing number of competing companies in the RP market but only three of the originals

remain today — 3D Systems, EOS and Stratasys. ! Throughout the 1990’s and early 2000’s a host of new technologies continued to be !13 3dprintingindustry.com History of 3D Printing ntroduced, still focused wholly on industrial applications and while they were still largely processes for prototyping applications, R&D was also being conducted by the more advanced technology providers for speciﬁc tooling, casting and direct manufacturing applications. This saw the emergence of new terminology, namely Rapid

Tooling (RT), Rapid Casting and Rapid Manufacturing (RM) respectively. ! In terms of commercial operations, Sanders Prototype (later Solidscape) and ZCorporation were set up in 1996, Arcam was established in 1997, Objet Geometries launched in 1998, MCP Technologies (an established vacuum casting OEM) introduced the SLM technology in 2000, EnvisionTec was founded in 2002, ExOne was established in 2005 as a spin- oﬀ from the Extrude Hone Corporation and Sciaky Inc was pioneering its own additive process based on its

proprietary electron beam welding technology. These companies all served to swell the ranks of Western companies operating across a global market. The terminology had also evolved with a proliferation of manufacturing applications and the accepted umbrella term for all of the processes was Additive Manufacturing (AM). Notably, there were many parallel !14 3dprintingindustry.com History of 3D Printing developments taking place in the Eastern hemisphere. However, these technologies, while signiﬁcant in themselves

and enjoying some local success, did not really impact the global market at that time. ! During the mid noughties, the sector started to show signs of distinct diversiﬁcation with two speciﬁc areas of emphasis that are much more clearly deﬁned today. First, there was the high end of 3D printing, still very expensive systems, which were geared towards part production for high value, highly engineered, complex parts. This is still ongoing — and growing — but the results are only now really starting to

become visible in production applications across the aerospace, automotive, medical and ﬁne jewellery sectors, as years of R&D and qualiﬁcation are now paying oﬀ. A great deal still remains behind closed doors and/or under non-disclosure agreements (NDA). At the other end of the spectrum, some of the 3D printing system manufacturers were developing and advancing ‘concept modellers’, as they were called at the time. Speciﬁcally, these were 3D printers that kept the focus on improving concept development and functional

prototyping, that were being developed speciﬁcally as oﬃce- and user-friendly, cost-eﬀective systems. The prelude to !15 3dprintingindustry.com History of 3D Printing today’s desktop machines. However, these systems were all still very much for industrial applications. ! Looking back, this was really the calm before the storm. ! At the lower end of the market — the 3D printers that today are seen as being in the mid range — a price war emerged together with incremental improvements in printing accuracy, speed and materials.

! In 2007, the market saw the ﬁrst system under $10,000 from 3D Systems, but this never quite hit the mark that it was supposed to. This was partly due to the system itself, but also other market inﬂuences. The holy grail at that time was to get a 3D printer under $5000 — this was seen by many industry insiders, users and commentators as the key to opening up 3D printing technology to a much wider audience. For much of that year, the arrival of the highly- anticipated Desktop Factory — which many predicted would

be the fulﬁllment of that holy grail — was heralded as the one to watch. It came to nothing as the organization faltered in the run up to production. Desktop Factory and its leader, Cathy Lewis, were acquired, along with the IP, by 3D Systems in 2008 and all but vanished. As it turned out though, 2007 was actually !16 3dprintingindustry.com History of 3D Printing the year that did mark the turning point for accessible 3D printing technology — even though few realized it at the time — as the RepRap

phenomenon took root. Dr Bowyer conceived the RepRap concept of an open source, self-replicating 3D printer as early as 2004, and the seed was germinated in the following years with some heavy slog from his team at Bath, most notably Vik Oliver and Rhys Jones, who developed the concept through to working prototypes of a 3D printer using the deposition process. 2007 was the year the shoots started to show through and this embryonic, open source 3D printing movement started to gain visibility. But it wasn’t until January 2009

that the ﬁrst commercially available 3D printer – in kit form and based on the RepRap concept – was oﬀered for sale. This was the BfB RapMan 3D printer. Closely followed by Makerbot Industries in April the same year, the founders of which were heavily involved in the development of RepRap until they departed from the Open Source philosophy following extensive investment. Since 2009, a host of similar deposition printers have emerged with marginal unique selling points (USPs) and they continue to do so. The

interesting dichotomy here is hat, while the RepRap phenomenon has given rise to a whole new sector of commercial, entry-level 3D !17 3dprintingindustry.com History of 3D Printing printers, the ethos of the RepRap community is all about Open Source developments for 3D printing and keeping commercialization at bay. ! 2012 was the year that alternative 3D printing processes were introduced at the entry level of the market. The B9Creator (utilising DLP technology) came ﬁrst in June, followed by the Form 1

(utilising stereolithography) in December. Both were launched via the funding site Kickstarter — and both enjoyed huge success. ! As a result of the market divergence, signiﬁcant advances at the industrial level with capabilities and applications, dramatic increase in awareness and uptake across a growing maker movement, 2012 was also the year that many diﬀerent mainstream media channels picked up on the technology. 2013 was a year of signiﬁcant growth and consolidation. One of the most notable moves was

the acquisition of Makerbot by Stratasys. ! Heralded as the 2nd, 3rd and, sometimes even, 4th Industrial Revolution by some, what cannot be denied is the impact that 3D printing is having on the industrial sector and the huge potential that 3D printing is demonstrating for the future of consumers. What shape that potential will take is still unfolding before us. !18 3dprintingindustry.com 3D Printing Technology CHAPTER !19 3D Printing Technology The starting point for any 3D printing process is a 3D digital

model, which can be created using a variety of 3D software programmes — in industry this is 3D CAD, for Makers and Consumers there are simpler, more accessible programmes available — or scanned with a 3D scanner. The model is then ‘sliced’ into layers, thereby converting the design into a ﬁle readable by the 3D printer. The material processed by the 3D printer is then layered according to the design and the process. As stated, there are a number of diﬀerent types of 3D printing technologies, which process diﬀerent

materials in diﬀerent ways to create the ﬁnal object. Functional plastics, metals, ceramics and sand are, now, all routinely used for industrial prototyping and production applications. Research is also being conducted for 3D printing bio materials and diﬀerent types of food. Generally speaking though, at the entry level of the market, materials are much more limited. Plastic is currently the only widely used material — usually ABS or PLA, but there are a growing number of alternatives, including Nylon.

There is also a growing number of entry level machines that have been adapted for foodstuﬀs, such as sugar and chocolate. !20 3dprintingindustry.com How it Works The diﬀerent types of 3D printers each employ a diﬀerent technology that processes diﬀerent materials in diﬀerent ways. It is important to understand that one of the most basic limitations of 3D printing — in terms of materials and applications — is that there is no ‘one solution ﬁts all’. For example some 3D printers process powdered materials

(nylon, plastic, ceramic, metal), which utilize a light/heat source to sinter/melt/fuse layers of the powder together in the deﬁned shape. Others process polymer resin materials and again utilize a light/laser to solidify the resin in ultra thin layers. Jetting of ﬁne droplets is another 3D printing process, reminiscent of 2D inkjet printing, but with superior materials to ink and a binder to ﬁx the layers. Perhaps the most common and easily recognized process is deposition, and this is the process employed by the

majority of entry-level 3D printers. This process extrudes plastics, commonly PLA or ABS, Start with a 3D CAD file either by creating the 3D model or scanned with a 3D scanner !21 3dprintingindustry.com How it Works in ﬁlament form through a heated extruder to form layers and create the predetermined shape. ! Because parts can be printed directly, it is possible to produce very detailed and intricate objects, often with functionality built in and negating the need for assembly. ! However, another important

point to stress is that none of the 3D printing processes come as plug and play options as of today. There are many steps prior to pressing print and more once the part comes oﬀ the printer — these are often overlooked. Apart from the realities of designing for 3D printing, which can be demanding, ﬁle preparation and conversion can also prove time-consuming and complicated, particularly for parts that demand intricate supports during the build process. However there are continual updates and upgrades of software for these

Layer by layer the printer will create the predetermined shape !22 3dprintingindustry.com How it Works functions and the situation is improving. Furthermore, once oﬀ the printer, many parts will need to undergo ﬁnishing operations. Support removal is an obvious one for processes that demand support, but others include sanding, lacquer, paint or other types of traditional ﬁnishing touches, which all typically need to be done by hand and require skill and/or time and patience. You will soon start to see

the object become more recognizable At the end of the print process you will have your finalized object !23 3dprintingindustry.com 3D Printing Processes CHAPTER !24 Stereolithography Stereolithography (SL) is widely recognized as the ﬁrst 3D printing process; it was certainly the ﬁrst to be commercialised. SL is a laser-based process that works with photopolymer resins, that react with the laser and cure to form a solid in a very precise way to produce very accurate parts. It is a complex process, but simply

put, the photopolymer resin is held in a vat with a movable platform inside. A laser beam is directed in the X-Y axes across the surface of the resin according to the 3D data supplied to the machine (the .stl ﬁle), whereby the resin hardens precisely where the laser hits the surface. Once the layer is completed, the platform within the vat drops down by a fraction (in the Z axis) and the subsequent layer is traced out by the laser. This continues until the entire object is completed and the platform

can be raised out of the vat for removal. !25 3dprintingindustry.com Stereolithography Because of the nature of the SL process, it requires support structures for some parts, speciﬁcally those with overhangs or undercuts. These structures need to be manually removed. ! In terms of other post processing steps, many objects 3D printed using SL need to be cleaned and cured. Curing involves subjecting the part to intense light in an oven-like machine to fully harden the resin. ! Stereolithography is generally accepted as being one of the most

accurate 3D printing processes with excellent surface ﬁnish. However limiting factors include the post-processing steps required and the stability of the materials over time, which can become more brittle. !26 3dprintingindustry.com DLP DLP — or digital light processing — is a similar process to stereolithography in that it is a 3D printing process that works with photopolymers. The major diﬀerence is the light source. DLP uses a more conventional light source, such as an arc lamp, with a liquid crystal display panel or a deformable mirror device (DMD),

which is applied to the entire surface of the vat of photopolymer resin in a single pass, generally making it faster than SL. ! Also like SL, DLP produces highly accurate parts with excellent resolution, but its similarities also include the same requirements for support structures and post-curing. However, one advantage of DLP over SL is that only a shallow vat of resin is required to facilitate the process, which generally results in less waste and lower running costs. !27 3dprintingindustry.com

Laser Sintering / Laser Melting Laser sintering and laser melting are interchangeable terms that refer to a laser based 3D printing process that works with powdered materials. The laser is traced across a powder bed of tightly compacted powdered material, according to the 3D data fed to the machine, in the X-Y axes. As the laser interacts with the surface of the powdered material it sinters, or fuses, the particles to each other forming a solid. As each layer is completed the powder bed drops incrementally and a roller smoothes the

powder over the surface of the bed prior to the next pass of the laser for the subsequent layer to be formed and fused with the previous layer. !28 3dprintingindustry.com Laser Sintering / Laser Melting The build chamber is completely sealed as it is necessary to maintain a precise temperature during the process speciﬁc to the melting point of the powdered material of choice. Once ﬁnished, the entire powder bed is removed from the machine and the excess powder can be removed to leave the ‘printed’ parts. One of

the key advantages of this process is that the powder bed serves as an in-process support structure for overhangs and undercuts, and therefore complex shapes that could not be manufactured in any other way are possible with this process. ! However, on the downside, because of the high temperatures required for laser sintering, cooling times can be considerable. Furthermore, porosity has been an historical issue with this process, and while there have been signiﬁcant improvements towards fully dense parts, some applications still necessitate

inﬁltration with another material to improve mechanical characteristics. ! Laser sintering can process plastic and metal materials, although metal sintering does require a much higher powered laser and higher in-process temperatures. Parts produced with this process are much stronger than with SL or DLP, although generally the surface ﬁnish and accuracy is not as good. !29 3dprintingindustry.com Extrusion / FDM / FFF 3D printing utilizing the extrusion of thermoplastic material is easily the most common — and recognizable — 3DP process. The

most popular name for the process is Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM), due to its longevity, however this is a trade name, registered by Stratasys, the company that originally developed it. Stratasys’ FDM technology has been around since the early 1990’s and today is an industrial grade 3D printing process. However, the proliferation of entry-level 3D printers that have emerged since 2009 largely utilize a similar process, generally referred to as Freeform Fabrication (FFF), but in a more basic form due to

patents still held by Stratasys. The earliest RepRap machines and all subsequent evolutions — open source and commercial — !30 3dprintingindustry.com employ extrusion methodology. However, following Stratasys’ patent infringement ﬁling against Aﬁnia there is a question mark over how the entry-level end of the market will develop now, with all of the machines potentially in Stratasys’ ﬁring line for patent infringements. ! The process works by melting plastic ﬁlament that is deposited, via a heated extruder, a layer at a time, onto a build platform

according to the 3D data supplied to the printer. Each layer hardens as it is deposited and bonds to the previous layer. ! Stratasys has developed a range of proprietary industrial grade materials for its FDM process that are suitable for some production applications. At the entry-level end of the market, materials are more limited, but the range is growing. The most common materials for entry-level FFF 3D printers are ABS and PLA. ! The FDM/FFF processes require support structures for any applications with overhanging geometries. For FDM, this entails a

second, water-soluble material, which allows support structures to be relatively easily washed away, once the print is complete. Alternatively, breakaway support materials are also possible, which can be removed by manually snapping them oﬀ the part. Extrusion / FDM / FFF !31 3dprintingindustry.com Extrusion / FDM / FFF Support structures, or lack thereof, have generally been a limitation of the entry level FFF 3D printers. However, as the systems have evolved and improved to incorporate dual extrusion

heads, it has become less of an issue. ! In terms of models produced, the FDM process from Stratasys is an accurate and reliable process that is relatively oﬃce/studio- friendly, although extensive post-processing can be required. At the entry-level, as would be expected, the FFF process produces much less accurate models, but things are constantly improving. ! The process can be slow for some part geometries and layer-to- layer adhesion can be a problem, resulting in parts that are not watertight. Again, post-processing using Acetone can resolve

these issues. !32 3dprintingindustry.com Inkjet: Binder Jetting There are two 3D printing process that utilize a jetting technique. ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! Binder jetting: where the material being jetted is a binder, and is selectively sprayed into a powder bed of the part material to fuse it a layer at a time to create/print the required part. As is the case with other powder bed systems, once a layer is completed, the powder bed drops incrementally and a roller or blade smoothes the powder over the surface of the bed, prior to the next pass of

the jet heads, with the binder for the subsequent layer to be formed and fused with the previous layer. !33 3dprintingindustry.com Inkjet: Binder Jetting Advantages of this process, like with SLS, include the fact that the need for supports is negated because the powder bed itself provides this functionality. Furthermore, a range of diﬀerent materials can be used, including ceramics and food. A further distinctive advantage of the process is the ability to easily add a full colour palette which can be added to the binder.

! The parts resulting directly from the machine, however, are not as strong as with the sintering process and require post-processing to ensure durability. !34 3dprintingindustry.com Inkjet: Material Jetting Material jetting: a 3D printing process whereby the actual build materials (in liquid or molten state) are selectively jetted through multiple jet heads (with others simultaneously jetting support materials). However, the materials tend to be liquid photopolymers, which are cured with a pass of UV light as each

layer is deposited. ! The nature of this product allows for the simultaneous deposition of a range of materials, which means that a single part can be produced from multiple materials with diﬀerent characteristics and properties. Material jetting is a very precise 3D printing method, producing accurate parts with a very smooth ﬁnish. !35 3dprintingindustry.com Selective Deposition Lamination (SDL) SDL is a proprietary 3D printing process developed and manufactured by Mcor Technologies. There is a temptation to

compare this process with the Laminated Object Manufacturing (LOM) process developed by Helisys in the 1990’s due to similarities in layering and shaping paper to form the ﬁnal part. However, that is where any similarity ends. ! The SDL 3D printing process builds parts layer by layer using standard copier paper. Each new layer is ﬁxed to the previous layer using an adhesive, which is applied selectively according to the 3D data supplied to the machine. This means that a much higher density of adhesive is deposited in the area that will

become the part, and a much lower density of adhesive is applied !36 3dprintingindustry.com Selective Deposition Lamination (SDL) in the surrounding area that will serve as the support, ensuring relatively easy “weeding,” or support removal. ! After a new sheet of paper is fed into the 3D printer from the paper feed mechanism and placed on top of the selectively applied adhesive on the previous layer, the build plate is moved up to a heat plate and pressure is applied. This pressure ensures a positive bond between the two sheets of paper. The build plate

then returns to the build height where an adjustable Tungsten carbide blade cuts one sheet of paper at a time, tracing the object outline to create the edges of the part. When this cutting sequence is complete, the 3D printer deposits the next layer of adhesive and so on until the part is complete. SDL is one of the very few 3D printing processes that can produce full colour 3D printed parts, using a CYMK colour palette. And because the parts are standard paper, which require no post- !37 3dprintingindustry.com

EBM The Electron Beam Melting 3D printing technique is a proprietary process developed by Swedish company Arcam. This metal printing method is very similar to the Direct Metal Laser Sintering (DMLS) process in terms of the formation of parts from metal powder. The key diﬀerence is the heat source, which, as the name suggests is an electron beam, rather than a laser, which necessitates that the procedure is carried out under vacuum conditions. ! EBM has the capability of creating fully- dense parts in a variety of metal alloys,

even to medical grade, and as a result the technique has been particularly successful for a range of production applications in the medical industry, particularly for implants. However, other hi-tech sectors such as aerospace and automotive have also looked to EBM technology for manufacturing fulﬁllment. !38 3dprintingindustry.com EBM processing, they are wholly safe and eco-friendly. Where the process is not able to compete favourably with other 3D printing processes is in the production of complex geometries and the

build size is limited to the size of the feedstock. !39 3dprintingindustry.com 3D Printing Materials CHAPTER !40 3D Printing Materials The materials available for 3D printing have come a long way since the early days of the technology. There is now a wide variety of diﬀerent material types, that are supplied in diﬀerent states (powder, ﬁlament, pellets, granules, resin etc). ! Speciﬁc materials are now generally developed for speciﬁc platforms performing dedicated applications (an example would be the dental sector) with material properties that more precisely

suit the application. ! However, there are now way too many proprietary materials from the many diﬀerent 3D printer vendors to cover them all here. Instead, this article will look at the most popular types of material in a more generic way. And also a couple of materials that stand out. !41 3dprintingindustry.com 3D Printing Materials: Plastics Nylon, or Polyamide, is commonly used in powder form with the sintering process or in ﬁlament form with the FDM process. It is a strong, ﬂexible and durable plastic material

that has proved reliable for 3D printing. It is naturally white in colour but it can be coloured — pre- or post printing. This material can also be combined (in powder format) with powdered aluminium to produce another common 3D printing material for sintering — Alumide. ! ABS is another common plastic used for 3D printing, and is widely used on the entry-level FDM 3D printers in ﬁlament form. It is a particularly strong plastic and comes in a wide range of colours. ABS can be bought in ﬁlament form from a number of non-

propreitary sources, which is another reason why it is so popular. ! PLA is a bio-degradable plastic material that has gained traction with 3D printing for this very reason. It can be utilized in resin format for DLP/SL processes as well as in ﬁlament form for the FDM process. It is oﬀered in a variety of colours, including transparent, which has proven to be a useful option for some !42 3dprintingindustry.com 3D Printing Materials: Plastics some applications of 3D printing. However it is not as durable or

as ﬂexible as ABS. ! LayWood is a specially developed 3D printing material for entry- level extrusion 3D printers. It comes in ﬁlament form and is a wood/polymer composite (also referred to as WPC). !43 3dprintingindustry.com 3D Printing Materials: Metals A growing number of metals and metal composites are used for industrial grade 3D printing. Two of the most common are aluminium and cobalt derivatives. ! One of the strongest and therefore most commonly used metals for 3D printing is Stainless Steel in powder form for the sintering/

melting/EBM processes. It is naturally silver, but can be plated with other materials to give a gold or bronze eﬀect. ! In the last couple of years Gold and Silver have been added to the range of metal materials that can be 3D printed directly, with obvious applications across the jewellery sector. These are both very strong materials and are processed in powder form. ! Titanium is one of the strongest possible metal materials and has been used for 3D printing industrial applications for some time.

Supplied in powder form, it can be used for the sintering/melting/ EBM processes. !44 3dprintingindustry.com 3D Printing Materials Ceramics Ceramics are a relatively new group of materials that can be used for 3D printing with various levels of success. The particular thing to note with these materials is that, post printing, the ceramic parts need to undergo the same processes as any ceramic part made using traditional methods of production — namely ﬁring and glazing. Paper Standard A4 copier paper is a 3D printing

material employed by the proprietary SDL process supplied by Mcor Technologies. The company operates a notably diﬀerent business model to other 3D printing vendors, whereby the capital outlay for the machine is in the mid-range, but the emphasis is very much on an easily obtainable, cost-eﬀective material supply, that can be bought locally. 3D printed models made with paper are safe, environmentally friendly, easily recyclable and require no post-processing. !45 3dprintingindustry.com 3D Printing Materials

Bio Materials There is a huge amount of research being conducted into the potential of 3D printing bio materials for a host of medical (and other) applications. Living tissue is being investigated at a number of leading institutions with a view to developing applications that include printing human organs for transplant, as well as external tissues for replacement body parts. Other research in this area is focused on developing food stuﬀs — meat being the prime example. Food Experiments with extruders for 3D

printing food substances has increased dramatically over the last couple of years. Chocolate is the most common (and desirable). There are also printers that work with sugar and some experiments with pasta and meat. Looking to the future, research is being undertaken, to utilize 3D printing technology to produce ﬁnely balanced whole meals. !46 3dprintingindustry.com 3D Printing Materials Other And ﬁnally, one company that does have a unique (proprietary) material oﬀering is Stratasys, with its digital materials for the

Objet Connex 3D printing platform. This oﬀering means that standard Objet 3D printing materials can be combined during the printing process — in various and speciﬁed concentrations — to form new materials with the required properties. Up to 140 diﬀerent Digital Materials can be realized from combining the existing primary materials in diﬀerent ways. !47 3dprintingindustry.com 3D Printing Global Eﬀects CHAPTER !48 Global Effects on Manufacturing 3D printing is already having an eﬀect on the way that

products are manufactured – the nature of the technology permits new ways of thinking in terms of the social, economic, environmental and security implications of the manufacturing process with universally favourable results. ! One of the key factors behind this statement is that 3D printing has the potential to bring production closer to the end user and/or the consumer, thereby reducing the current supply chain restrictions. The customisation value of 3D printing and the ability to produce small production

batches on demand is a sure way to engage consumers AND reduce or negate inventories and stock piling — something similar to how Amazon operates its business. !49 3dprintingindustry.com Global Effects on Manufacturing Shipping spare parts and products from one part of the world to the other could potentially become obsolete, as the spare parts might possibly be 3D printed on site. This could have a major impact on how businesses large and small, the military and consumers operate and interact on a global scale in the

future. The ultimate aim for many is for consumers to operate their own 3D printer at home, or within their community, whereby digital designs of any (customizable) product are available for download via the internet, and can be sent to the printer, which is loaded with the correct material(s). Currently, there is some debate about whether this will ever come to pass, and even more rigorous debate about the time frame in which it may occur. ! The wider adoption of 3D printing would likely cause re-

invention of a number of already invented products, and, of course, an even bigger number of completely new products. Today previously impossible shapes and geometries can be created with a 3D printer, but the journey has really only just begun. 3D printing is believed by many to have very great potential to inject growth into innovation and bring back local manufacturing. !50 3dprintingindustry.com Potential Effects to the Global Economy The use of 3D printing technology has potential eﬀects on the global economy,

if adopted world wide. The shift of production and distribution from the current model to a localized production based on-demand, on site, customized production model could potentially reduce the imbalance between export and import countries. ! 3D printing would have the potential to create new industries and completely new professions, such as those related to the production of 3D printers. There is an opportunity for professional services around 3D printing, ranging from new forms of product designers, printer

operators, material suppliers all the way to intellectual property legal disputes and settlements. Piracy is a current concern related to 3D printing for many IP holders. ! The eﬀect of 3D printing on the developing world is a double- edged sword. One example of the positive eﬀect is lowered manufacturing cost through recycled and other local materials, but the loss of manufacturing jobs could hit many developing countries severely, which would take time to overcome. ! !51 3dprintingindustry.com

Potential Effects to the Global Economy The developed world, would beneﬁt perhaps the most from 3D printing, where the growing aged society and shift of age demographics has been a concern related to production and work force. Also the health beneﬁts of the medical use of 3D printing would cater well for an aging western society. !52 3dprintingindustry.com 3D Printing Beneﬁts & Value CHAPTER !53 3D Printing Benefits & Value 3D printing, whether at an industrial, local or personal level, brings a host of beneﬁts that traditional methods of manufacture

(or prototyping) simply cannot. 3D printing processes allow for mass customization — the ability to personalize products according to individual needs and requirements. Even within the same build chamber, the nature of 3D printing means that numerous products can be manufactured at the same time according to the end-users requirements at no additional process cost. Customisation !54 3dprintingindustry.com The advent of 3D printing has seen a proliferation of products (designed in digital environments), which involve levels of

complexity that simply could not be produced physically in any other way. While this advantage has been taken up by designers and artists to impressive visual eﬀect, it has also made a signiﬁcant impact on industrial applications, whereby applications are being developed to materialize complex components that are proving to be both lighter and stronger than their predecessors. Notable uses are emerging in the aerospace sector where these issues are of primary importance. 3D Printing Benefits & Value

For industrial manufacturing, one of the most cost-, time- and labour-intensive stages of the product development process is the production of the tools. For low to medium volume applications, industrial 3D printing — or additive manufacturing — can eliminate the need for tool production and, therefore, the costs, lead times and labour associated with it. This is an extremely attractive proposition, that an increasing number or manufacturers are taking advantage of. Furthermore, because of the complexity

advantages stated above, products and components can be designed speciﬁcally to avoid assembly requirements with intricate geometry and complex features further eliminating the labour and costs associated with assembly processes. Tool-less Complexity !55 3dprintingindustry.com 3D printing is also emerging as an energy-eﬃcient technology that can provide environmental eﬃciencies in terms of both the manufacturing process itself, utilising up to 90% of standard materials, and, therefore, creating less waste, but also throughout

an additively manufactured product’s operating life, by way of lighter and stronger design that imposes a reduced carbon footprint compared with traditionally manufactured products. ! Furthermore, 3D printing is showing great promise in terms of fulﬁlling a local manufacturing model, whereby products are produced on demand in the place where they are needed — eliminating huge inventories and unsustainable logistics for shipping high volumes of products around the world. 3D Printing Benefits & Value

Sustainable / Environmentally Friendly !56 3dprintingindustry.com 3D Printing Applications CHAPTER !57 The origins of 3D printing in ‘Rapid Prototyping’ were founded on the principles of industrial prototyping as a means of speeding up the earliest stages of product development with a quick and straightforward way of producing prototypes that allows for multiple iterations of a product to arrive more quickly and eﬃciently at an optimum solution. This saves time and money at the outset of the entire product development process and ensures conﬁdence ahead

of production tooling. ! Prototyping is still probably the largest, even though sometimes overlooked, application of 3D printing today. ! The developments and improvements of the process and the materials, since the emergence of 3D printing for prototyping, saw the processes being taken up for applications further down the product development process chain. Tooling and casting applications were developed utilizing the advantages of the diﬀerent processes. Again, these applications are increasingly being used and

adopted across industrial sectors. ! Similarly for ﬁnal manufacturing operations, the improvements are continuing to facilitate uptake. ! In terms of the industrial vertical markets that are beneﬁtting greatly from industrial 3D printing across all of these broad spectrum applications, the following is a basic breakdown: 3D Printing Applications !58 3dprintingindustry.com 3D Printing Applications The medical sector is viewed as being one that was an early adopter of 3D printing, but also a sector with huge

potential for growth, due to the customization and personalization capabilities of the technologies and the ability to improve people’s lives as the processes improve and materials are developed that meet medical grade standards. ! 3D printing technologies are being used for a host of diﬀerent applications. In addition to making prototypes to support new product development for the medical and dental industries, the technologies are also utilized to make patterns for the downstream metal casting of

dental crowns and in the manufacture of tools over which plastic is being vacuum formed to make dental aligners. The technology is also taken advantage of directly to manufacture both stock items, such as hip and knee implants, and bespoke patient-speciﬁc Medical and Dental !59 3dprintingindustry.com 3D Printing Applications products, such as hearing aids, orthotic insoles for shoes, personalised prosthetics and one-oﬀ implants for patients suﬀering from diseases such as osteoarthritis, osteoporosis and

cancer, along with accident and trauma victims. 3D printed surgical guides for speciﬁc operations are also an emerging application that is aiding surgeons in their work and patients in their recovery. Technology is also being developed for the 3D printing of skin, bone, tissue, pharmaceuticals and even human organs. However, these technologies remain largely decades away from commercialisation. !60 3dprintingindustry.com 3D Printing Applications Like the medical sector, the aerospace sector was an early

adopter of 3D printing technologies in their earliest forms for product development and prototyping. These companies, typically working in partnership with academic and research institutes, have been at the sharp end in terms or pushing the boundaries of the technologies for manufacturing applications. ! Because of the critical nature of aircraft development, the R&D is demanding and strenuous, standards are critical and industrial grade 3D printing systems are put through their paces. Process and materials development

have seen a number of key applications developed for the aerospace sector — and some non-critical parts are all-ready ﬂying on aircraft. ! Aerospace !61 3dprintingindustry.com 3D Printing Applications High proﬁle users include GE / Morris Technologies, Airbus / EADS, Rolls-Royce, BAE Systems and Boeing. While most of these companies do take a realistic approach in terms of what they are doing now with the technologies, and most of it is R&D, some do get quite bullish about the future. !62 3dprintingindustry.com

3D Printing Applications Another general early adopter of Rapid Prototying technologies — the earliest incarnation of 3D printing — was the automotive sector. Many automotive companies — particularly at the cutting edge of motor sport and F1 — have followed a similar trajectory to the aerospace companies. First (and still) using the technologies for prototyping applications, but developing and adapting their manufacturing processes to incorporate the beneﬁts of improved materials and end results for automotive parts.

! Many automotive companies are now also looking at the potential of 3D printing to fulﬁll after sales functions in terms of production of spare/ replacement parts, on demand, rather than holding huge inventories. Automotive !63 3dprintingindustry.com 3D Printing Applications Traditionally, the design and manufacturing process for jewellery has always required high levels of expertise and knowledge involving speciﬁc disciplines that include fabrication, mould-making, casting, electroplating, forging,

silver/gold smithing, stone- cutting, engraving and polishing. Each of these disciplines has evolved over many years and each requires technical knowledge when applied to jewellery manufacture. Just one example is investment casting — the origins of which can be traced back more than 4000 years. ! For the jewellery sector, 3D printing has proved to be particularly disruptive. There is a great deal of interest — and uptake — based on how 3D printing can, and will, contribute to the further development of this industry.

From new design freedoms enabled by 3D CAD and 3D printing, through improving traditional processes for Jewellery !64 3dprintingindustry.com 3D Printing Applications jewellery production all the way to direct 3D printed production eliminating many of the traditional steps, 3D printing has had — and continues to have — a tremendous impact in this sector. !65 3dprintingindustry.com 3D Printing Applications Artists and Sculptors are engaging with 3D printing in myriad of diﬀerent ways to explore form and function in ways previously

impossible. Whether purely to ﬁnd new original expression or to learn from old masters this is a highly charged sector that is increasingly ﬁnding new ways of working with 3D printing and introducing the results to the world. There are numerous artists that have now made a name for themselves by working speciﬁcally with 3D modelling, 3D scanning and 3D printing technologies. ! • Joshua Harker • Dizingof • Jessica Rosenkrantz at Nervous System • Pia Hinze • Nick Ervinck • Lionel Dean • And many others.

Art / Design / Sculpture !66 3dprintingindustry.com 3D Printing Applications The discipline of 3D scanning in conjunction with 3D printing also brings a new dimension to the art world, however, in that artists and students now have a proven methodology of reproducing the work of past masters and creating exact replicas of ancient (and more recent) sculptures for close study – works of art that they would otherwise never have been able to interact with in person. The work of Cosmo Wenman is particularly enlightening in this

ﬁeld. !67 3dprintingindustry.com 3D Printing Applications Architectural models have long been a staple application of 3D printing processes, for producing accurate demonstration models of an architect’s vision. 3D printing oﬀers a relatively fast, easy and economically viable method of producing detailed models directly from 3D CAD, BIM or other digital data that architects use. Many successful architectural ﬁrms, now commonly use 3D printing (in house or as a service) as a critical part of their workﬂow

for increased innovation and improved communication. ! More recently some visionary architects are looking to 3D printing as a direct construction method. Research is being conducted at a number of organizations on this front, most notably Loughborough University, Contour Crafting and Universe Architecture. Architecture !68 3dprintingindustry.com 3D Printing Applications As 3D printing processes have improved in terms of resolution and more ﬂexible materials, one industry, renowned for experimentation

and outrageous statements, has come to the fore. We are of course talking about fashion! ! 3D printed accessories including shoes, head-pieces, hats and bags have all made their way on to global catwalks. And some even more visionary fashion designers have demonstrated the capabilities of the tech for haute couture — dresses, capes, full-length gowns and even some under wear have debuted at diﬀerent fashion venues around the world. ! Iris van Herpen should get a special mention as the leading pioneer in this vein. She has

produced a number of collections — modelled on the catwalks of Paris and Milan — that incorporate 3D printing to blow up the ‘normal rules’ that no longer apply to fashion design. Many have followed, and continue to follow, in her footsteps, often with wholly original results. Fashion !69 3dprintingindustry.com 3D Printing Applications Although a late-comer to the 3D printing party, food is one emerging application (and/or 3D printing material) that is getting people very excited and has the potential to truly take

the technology into the mainstream. After all, we will all, always, need to eat! 3D printing is emerging as a new way of preparing and presenting food. ! Initial forays into 3D printing food were with chocolate and sugar, and these developments have continued apace with speciﬁc 3D printers hitting the market. Some other early experiments with food including the 3D printing of “meat” at the cellular protein level. More recently pasta is another food group that is being researched for 3D printing food.

! Looking to the future 3D printing is also being considered as a complete food preparation method and a way of balancing nutrients in a comprehensive and healthy way. Food !70 3dprintingindustry.com 3D Printing Applications The holy grail for 3D printing vendors is consumer 3D printing. There is a widespread debate as to whether this is a feasible future. Currently, consumer uptake is low due to the accessibility issues that exist with entry level (consumer machines). There is headway being made in this direction by the larger 3D printing

companies such as 3D Systems and Makerbot, as a subsidiary of Stratasys as they try to make the 3D printing process and the ancillary components (software, digital content etc) more accessible and user-friendly.

INTRODUCTION TO ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING 1.1. What is Additive Manufacturing? Additive Manufacturing or 3D printing (commonly called) is a process that creates a physical

object from a digital design. There are different 3D printing technologies and materials you can print with, but all are based on the same principle: a digital model is turned into a solid three-dimensional physical object by adding material layer by layer. [1] It is important to point out from the beginning that Additive Manufacturing does not constitute a single technology but a set of manufacturing processes, very different from each other, that share three common characteristics: 1. They are manufacturing processes by addition of material to construct a solid three-

dimensional object. 2. The object is constructed by superimposing successive layers of material. 3. The object is made from a digital 3D model. They are called ADITIVE Manufacturing processes to differentiate them from conventional processes. Together with these, they are part of the set of processes available to the Industry. PROCESSES AND MANUFACTURING TECHNIQUES Subtractive Manufacturing. Forming Process (SPF) Additive Manufacturing Joining process Scheme 1: Processes and manufacturing techniques. [2]

7 Some of the most used additive manufacturing technologies that best suits to the educational area will be described in the following point of this guide. These technologies are: Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM), Stereolithographic (SLA) and Selective Laser Sintering (SLS). Figure 3: SLS Printer. [5] 1.2. How does 3D printing work? It all starts with making or obtaining a virtual design of the object you want to create. This virtual design can be made in a CAD (Computer Aided Design) file using a 3D modeling program

(for the creation of a totally new object) or with the use of a 3D scanner (to copy an existing object). A 3D scanner makes a 3D digital copy of an object.  There are also lots of online file repositories where you can download existing 3D files that will help get you started. The 3D printing process turns an object into many, tiny little slices, then builds it from the bottom up, slice by slice. The layers then build up to form a solid object. [6] Figure 1: FDM Printer. [3] Figure 2: SLA Printer. [4]

8 The full process is explained in the point 3 of this guide. Some advantages of Additive Manufacturing compared to conventional processes: • Fewer steps between the CAD model and the production of the part. • Generally, few human resource requirements due to a high level of automation. • A large number of geometrical forms can be manufactured, enabling for instance the production of parts which are topologically optimised, with internal channels, etc. • High-speed manufacturing for small, complex parts.

• Generally, less material wastage. • Possibility to reconstruct damaged sections of existing objects, depending on the part material • No special tooling required. 1.3. What is Rapid Prototyping? Rapid prototyping is an automated process that quickly builds physical prototypes from 3D CAD files composed of surface quality or solid models. Any manufacturing process can be classified as either subtractive, formative or additive. Every manufacturing process either falls completely into one of these categories or is a hybrid process falling into more than one. In

the manufacturing arena, productivity is achieved by guiding a product from concept to market quickly and inexpensively. Rapid prototyping technology aids this process. [8] Design STL file OBJ file ... G-Code 3D Print 3D Object Figure 4: 3D printing process. [7] 9 It is important not to confuse rapid prototyping with 3D printing or with additive manufacturing, because the concepts are used interchangeably and wrongly many times. We can say that additive manufacturing is one of the technologies with which we can produce a

rapid prototyping product. It is convenient to underline that every technology and every process has a starting point in common: computer aided design (CAD). Here some of the most common techniques for Rapid Prototyping: • 3D Scanner / Reverse Engineering. • Additive Manufacturing. • CNC Machining. • Vacuum Fast Casting. • Prototype Moulds. • Sand Casting. • Investment Casting. The purpose of rapid prototyping is to test the various design features, ideas, concepts, functionality, output and performance.

2. TECHNOLOGIES In order to identify the most suitable 3D printing technologies for educational purposes, the following table was developed. It presents a comparison between a total of 7 technologies, which are the most used currently, according to the latest trends. The analysis was based on 12 parameters, which are considered the best ones in order to have a full overview on what 3D printing offers. Special focus was given to strengths and weaknesses for each technology as they are important indicators in the identification.

10 Through the study carried out in the report IO1 / A3: Identification of 3D printing most suitable technologies for education, the consortium identified the three printing technologies described below as the most recommended for use in the educational field. Here, in addition to the Process, Materials, Application Areas, the Strengths and Weaknesses are also described for each one of them. Figure 5: Prototypes of a ski goggles' frame printed with FDM, SLA and SLS technology (from left to right). [9]

11 Figure 6: 3DP Technologies Comparison. [10] 12 2.1. FUSED DEPOSITION MODELING (FDM) 2.1.1. Process, Materials, Application Areas Home printers typically work with plastic filament. The technology behind this is often referred to Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) is a 3D printing technology that works by extruding a thermoplastic polymer through a heated nozzle which gets deposited on a building stage. FDM is also considered to be a form of additive manufacturing, which at the same time is a “process of joining materials to make objects from 3D model data, usually layer upon

layer”. Creating a 3D printed object through FDM requires, in the first place, to work on a STL file (stereo lithography file format) which mathematically slices and orients the model for the next building process. Sometimes, the software is capable of generating support structures for the object automatically. In general, the machine requires materials for both the object and the support. [11] The mere process involves a plastic filament which is fed by a spool to the nozzle where the material is liquefied and “drawn” on the platform. As soon as it touches the build stage, the

filament hardens while being gradually deposited, following a certain structure, in order to create the final 3D print. When a layer is drawn, the platform lowers by one layer thickness so that the printer is able to start working on the next layer. Figure 7: FDM Technology. [12] 13 There are many different materials which can be used with FDM. In the first place, they are divided between the industrial and the consumer categories. The most commonly used are ABS (Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene), PLA (Polyactic Acid) and Nylon (Polyamide), but other

exotic varieties of materials can also be used, like a material blend of plastic and wood or carbon. [13] Because this technology presents some very good pros, FDM is often used in the area of non- functional prototypes in order to produce concept parts, functional models, prototypes in general, manufacturing tooling and modeling, and end use parts. More specifically, FDM can be used for low-volume production and prototypes aimed at form, fit and function tests. At the same time, it is most commonly used in the aerospace sector, for example, to produce

wind turbines. Anatomical models for medical use are also very much suitable to be built with this technology. Finally, FDM has slowly been enabling the rapid prototyping of biomedical micro devices, the kind of devices that are used on a daily basis in hospitals, for example, therefore very much fundamental, as it is considered both cheap, but at the same very safe. [14] Since 2004, FDM technology has been used in a particular sector to produce load-bearing scaffold, which, according to a study, “has the potential for osteochondral defect repair”. [15]

2.1.2. Strengths and Weaknesses When it comes to 3D printing technology, one of the very first concerns relate to its cost. While in general it is the long-term use of materials that can become a serious expense, those who want to engage with Fused Deposition Modeling have an advantage from the start; in fact, FDM printing machines are among the cheapest and most affordable especially for those who want to use it in a domestic environment. Many brands today are available pre-built like Maker Bot and Ultimaker, two of the most popular desktop 3D printers, or can be built using

DIY kits or going from the grounds up and printing parts to create a 3D printer. Always on a positive side, FDM is considered to be a very clean technology, usually simple-to- use and office-friendly. The technology can also produce complex geometries and cavities that would otherwise be quite problematic. [16] As for accuracy, the 3D prints do not reach the same level of accuracy and quality of other items which are instead produced through the use of Stereolithograpy. That said, the result is considered to be fairly qualitative, depending on the sector where the technology is applied.

14 Resolution depends mainly on the size of the nozzle that is used. The precision of the machine is dependent on the extruder movements on the X and Y axis, but there are other factors to be taken into consideration. For example, the bonding force between the layers is lower than in the Stereolithography process. Consequently, the weight of the layers might squeeze the lower layers, which can therefore influence and even compromise the quality of the 3D print. Contrary to SLA, FDM presents also an increased complexity. One needs to keep in mind

weight and size, but also constraints. It is very important to make sure that a print can meet the expectations that one sees on the screen when first modelling. The constraints in this case depend on several factors, but mainly on the material chosen, through which it is possible to understand how big an item can be printed through FDM. [17] Another negative side of FDM is that it presents a generally slower compared to both Sterelithography and Selective Laser Sintering, which is to be analysed next. Moreover,

Surface finish is considered fair, but not at the same level as these other two technologies. In fact, when printing with FDM, one needs to take into the consideration that the chances are a print will require post processing and finishing. Figure 8: FDM advantages. [18] 15 2.2. SELECTIVE LASER SINTERING (SLS) 2.2.1. Process, Materials, Application Areas Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) is a technique that uses laser as power source to form solid 3D objects. This technique was developed by Carl Deckard, a student of Texas University, and his

professor Joe Beaman in 1980s. Later on they took part in foundation of Desk Top Manufacturing (DTM) Corp., that was sold to its big competitor 3D Systems in 2001. SLS in some way is very similar to Selective Laser Sintering. The main difference between SLS and SLA is that it uses powdered material in the vat instead of liquid resin. Unlike Stereolithography and Fused Deposition Modeling, Selective Laser Sintering does not require the use of support structures, therefore cutting the amount of materials that one

needs to provide for the print. The object is, in fact, printed while being constantly surrounded by not sintered powder. The mere process involves a laser which is used to selectively sinter a layer of granules, consequently binding together the material to create a solid form. At the end of the process, the object can very hot and therefore it will be left to cool off before being removed from the machine. Figure 9: SLS technology. [19] 16 The use of SLS technology makes it possible to involve a variety of materials which range from

nylon, glass and ceramics, to aluminium, silver and even steel. However, some of them, like ceramics, are not laser sintered. A binder, in this case, is used to glue parts together and this is usually known as “Powder & Binder-based 3D Printing”. The starting process of this technology is quite similar to Laser Sintering: a roller puts a thin layer of powder on a platform. However, instead of a laser beam, a special print head places a binding agent at specific points, printing a thin layer of your model that is able to bind to

subsequent layers. This process is then repeated over and over again until your model is complete. Since in this case the model was only "glued" together, some post processing is. The exact post-processing steps heavily depend on the material: Multicolour models get a bath in superglue, Ceramic prints are put in a drying oven and fired several times, High Detail Stainless Steel and Steel objects are placed in an oven for fusing. Steel models are additionally infused with Bronze for extra strength. [20]

Areas of application of SLS technology range from the automotive sector to the consumer goods sector. More specifically, it can be used in the case of product development and rapid prototyping in a wide range of commercial industries, as well as limited-run manufacturing of end-use parts. In the aerospace industry, for example, SLS is involved to build prototypes for aircraft components. This represents a great advantage for companies because airplanes are produced in small quantities since airlines companies, for example, use them for quite a long

time. Therefore, it is not cost-effective for production companies to build physical moulds for airplane parts. In fact, these moulds would be too expensive to make and would then need to be stored for long periods of time without being damaged or corroded. [21] Therefore, SLS is perfect for small batches production. Even more interesting is the fact that SLS has been slowly introduced in the sector of consumer goods, specifically for production of shoes. According the producers, the use of nylon

sintered by SLS can produce a shoe with not only reduced weight, but also customizations, while being able to adapt the shoe to the needs and the requirements of the customer. [22] Figure 10: Shoe silhouette created using SLS. [23] 17 Success with titanium would be one example of huge future opportunities with the military, aerospace, medical and other industries looking to utilize titanium’s light weight, strength and corrosion resistance. Much of the ground-breaking activity in 3D printing has utilized plastics

and moving from plastics into metals of all types is the next step. 2.2.2. Strengths and Weaknesses One of the very first pros that Selective Laser Sintering presents is the fact that it makes no use of support structures, as it is fully self-supporting. It therefore allows parts to be built within other parts in a process called nesting. This has two main outcomes; the first one is that it reduces the costs of the material which would therefore be used in order to provide support structures, greatly used in the FDM technology. The second advantage in this case is that SLS

can handle a high complexity of geometry. Some products are that complex that without this technology it would be complicated to produce them. Generally, SLS is considered the 3D printing technology with the fastest additive manufacturing process for printing functional, durable prototypes and end user parts. Durability is, moreover, supported by the use of strong materials like nylon, which also allows a certain freedom in the functionality of the final 3D print. Besides, thanks to its excellent

mechanical properties, the material used in SLS is often a substitute of typical injection moulding plastics. At the same time, SLS produces parts which are generally rated to be very strong and stiff, with good chemical resistance. Complex parts with interior components, channels, can be built without trapping the material inside and altering the surface from support removal. Accuracy is another important advantage of SLS technology. Final 3D prints present, usually, a high accuracy. The required process is also fast, compared to the already analysed

technologies. At the same time, scalability allows to use SLS for a single part of component, but also and easily for dozens of production pieces. Parts can be usually shipped between 1 and 4 days, which is a great advantage for companies who are required to be quick in the market. However, usually SLS prints present a certain surface porosity hence why, just like in Fused Deposition Modeling, post-processing is definitely required. 18 2.3. STEREOLITHOGRAPHY (SLA) 2.3.1. Process, Materials, Application Areas

Stereolithography (SLA) is a light-based process that builds individual layers of a model with liquid polymer, hardened by a laser beam. It is the oldest technology in the history of 3D printing, but it is still very much used nowadays. The process involves the use of a printing machine called “stereolithograph apparatus” which converts liquid plastic into solid 3D objects. The laser is directed and controlled by two galvanometers. After each layer, the resin tank peels away to release the hardened material.

The building platform then moves up from 25 to 200 microns, depending on the chosen layer height, to prepare for the process of solidifying the next layer. The part appears to be built upside down, which is called inverse stereolithography. Figure 11: Resin 3D Printer parts overview. [24] When it comes to materials, Stereolithography offers a variety of choices which can be summarized in three categories. Within the first, paintable resin can be used. In this case, the process takes place in a large tank, and begins when a layer of liquid polymer is spread over a

platform. A computer-controlled laser draws the first layer onto the surface of a liquid 19 polymer, which hardens. As the model is then lowered, the next layer is drawn directly on top of the previous one and repeated until the model is finished. When the model is complete, it is raised out of the tank and the excess liquid flows away. The supports are removed manually after the model is taken from the machine. Transparent resin and prime grey are two other kinds of resin material that can be used as

well. From a simple magnifier glass to waveguide to a see-through mechanism or virtually unlimited decorative objects, transparent resin can deliver amazing results. Just as with translucent resins, if one adds some lights to their project printed with this material one will definitely grab people’s attention. This material can be mixed with pigments before printing resulting in an attractive looking transparent colour object. The transparency varies from translucent to water-clear. The water clear transparency can be achieved in special cases and upon request. Transparent resin has

a great surface quality. The surface is smooth, and the stair-stepping look of 3D printing can be reduced by sandpapering. Transparent resin models are painted with a shiny varnish to prevent discolouration from UV light. The natural surface of your transparent resin model is known as basic finish. Resin based models will always be smoother than powder-based models. The technology used for your transparent resin model requires extra material to support your model during the printing process, but these supports are removed before your model is cured.

The surface of the 3D printed model is defined by the material and technology. With basic finish, some building layers will still be visible. The natural surface option is always the cheapest. The number of post-finishing steps also determines the cost and quality of your transparent resin model. The material is transparent, but not 100% water clear. When a model is solid with a thickness greater than 2 cm, the printed part presents a bluish tint. For the transparent finish, the model is painted with colourless varnish. For transparent colour finishes, pigment is added to the

varnish. Grey Resin instead, formerly known as Prime Grey, is suitable for A-side visual models with limited functionality. The surface of the material is very smooth, much smoother in fact than almost all other 3D printing materials. The colour is Air Force Grey and the material feels almost “luxurious” to the touch. The material has a medium mechanical resistance. Freedom of design is limited because of the structure necessary to support your models during printing. 20 Models made in Grey Resin are typically used as high-quality show models. Design and

engineering departments use the models as visual prototypes or for presentations, but we have noticed that it works really well for character and toy models. The difference between transparent resin and prime grey stays in the result that one wants to accomplish. For example, Prime Grey is excellent when it comes to its impact strength and the accuracy in the details. At the same time, paintable resin allows to choose a colour at one’s choice, but it still needs support structure, therefore limiting the freedom of design. This can

be avoided using prime grey. A summary table for all three kinds of resins is available below. Figure 12: Resins, properties. [25] Stereolithography can be used in many areas. Nowadays, the automotive, aerospace, medical and consumer goods fields are the most popular ones. It can, in fact, be applied to the domestic field: one can easily make 3D prints starting from their own model. At the same time, this technology allows to print medical models of anatomic human parts, which can be very much useful in class, for example, in order to give a proper overview on the functionality of

the human body to a group of scholars. It therefore changes the way subjects are taught and it can be applied in technical subjects like science, engineering, but also arts and math. 2.3.2. Strengths and Weaknesses Among all the 3D printing technologies, Stereolithography is one of the best; its strength relies mainly on the high resolution of the 3D prints. It allows to print objects with very complex geometries while at the same time preserving the quality and the details. Accuracy is in fact generally rated to be very good in this case. SLA is all about precision and it is often used where

form, fit and assembly are critical. This is especially due to the use of the resin, in particular the so-called photopolymer materials. 21 The latter are, in fact, liquid materials which are cured and hardened; they also allow a certain freedom when it comes to colours, opacity and rigidity, while offering an excellent surface quality. At the same time, although there are faster and more recent technologies out there, Stereolithography can perform correctly in a reasonable period of time, while also allowing to

save time on highly precise parts. In this way, prototypes, which is a common use for Stereolithography, can be made easily and faithfully to the initial design. Complexity is, therefore, not a problem. Moreover, the positive side of using Stereolithography and resins material is customization, especially in the form of which colour one wants. Spray print in this case is one of the methods used to achieve this result. Four kinds of paints are available: dead matt, matt, satin, and high gloss, each with a different gloss factor. The higher the gloss factor, the shinier the model will

look. Paint sprayed on larger areas will exhibit bigger visual differences between the different paint options. We can spray paint, your model to match your needs or you could also do this at home yourself. However, costs are one of the major weaknesses in the case of Stereolithography. While 3D printing machines can be more or less affordable, photopolymer materials can be very expensive, making the ordinary use of this technology not affordable to everyone. Besides, although they come in different colours, there is still a limited choice of photopolymers.

Cons when it comes to Stereolithography involve also the fact that liquid resins are generally irritating and toxic, therefore some precautions are to be taken in order to work with them using the appropriate tools and equipment. Moreover, prints usually require cleaning, which can in some cases take time and a lot of effort. Post-processing is generally needed if one wants to achieve the highest quality possible. This will also depend on the material chosen, which will consequently lead to more or less steps to be taken care of.

Not to be forgotten is the fact that Stereolithography, contrary to its similar technology which is Selective Laser Sintering, requires support structures, which makes the price more expensive, as more material is required. The distinction and the consequent choice between these two technologies Figure 13: Photocentric 3D prints. [26] 22 mainly depends on the material one wants to use and the result one wants to achieve. 3. PRODUCTION PROCESS IN 3D PRINTING Hereunder, in this chapter, all the necessary processes and steps for, starting with a digital

design, obtaining a real printed piece, are going to be described. It is important to mention that there is not just a single valid process for printing three dimensional pieces. What is explained in this guide are a certain number of steps that should be adapted to the type of piece, selected technology, type of machine, and even to the used software. Furthermore, the process that is described hereunder is mostly intended for fused deposition modelling (FDM) 3D printers. The production process, in general, is the following:

1. Obtaining the digital model 2. Exporting and repairing the STL file 3. Testing, orientation, distribution and G-Code Scheme 2: Production process in 3D printing. [27] 4. 3D printing 5. Extracting pieces 6. Post-processing 23 It is important that the tips given in each of the steps of the process are indicative and they have general term. This means that the tips should not be followed very closely. In the production process for 3D printing, experience, piece features, used machine, etc. have a lot

of weight. It is for sure that someone with little or without experience will 3D print a lot of piece with failures, before he finds the key. Now, each of these steps of the production process are explained in more detail and deeper. 3.1. Obtaining the digital model There are several possibilities for obtaining the 3D model or digital model that is wanted to print. In particular, there are three possibilities: • To model the piece using a CAD software: With this first option, in order to get the

three-dimensional model, a computer aided design (CAD) software must be used. There are a lot of available CAD software for modelling, and there is not a best option; it will depend on the user and their abilities with the software. Figure 14: Piece modelled with Rhinoceros. [28] • To obtain the geometry by Reverse Engineering and 3D scanners: By this option a 3D scanner is used to digitally obtain the geometry of a real object. This is not a simple process and some ability and experience is required. In addition, there are several

types of 3D scanners, and they are usually expensive. The reverse engineering process usually is for copying, improving, or customizing real objects, or also for incorporating complex surfaces to a 3D modelled piece. 24 The process is normally the following: firstly, the geometry is captured by a 3D scanner. Then, this geometry is treated or modified, so that it is adequate for 3D printing. That is to say, if it is obtained a point cloud from the 3D scanning, this cloud has to be "sewed" and converted to a polygonal mesh (sometimes the 3D scanner software does

it) and finally exported (converted) to a solid body. Finally, the process of 3D printing will be implemented. • Downloading the model from repositories or asking someone to design it for you: If you do not have knowledge in computer-aided 3D design, or you do not have the necessary equipment (or software, or even knowledge) for applying a process of reverse engineering, to download the model from a repository or to ask somebody to design it for you is the best option. Depending on whether the repository is a 3D

printing model repository (e.g.: Thingiverse) or a more general digital model repository (e.g.: GrabCAD), the downloaded model will be ready for 3D printing or it will be not. 3D geometry adquisition Treatment and modification of the geometry 3D printing Figure 15: Reverse engineering process. [29] 25 Figure 16: Examples of pieces from Thingiverse repository. [30] No matter how the digital model is obtained, what it is important is to get a robust 3D model, thought for 3D printing. That is to say that any designed and modelled piece, or scanned piece,

or downloaded from the internet, could not be adequate for being 3D printed. This means that some issues such as internal gaps, the precision to achieve, the detail level, the size of the piece, if the piece has overhangs, make it a closed solid (watertight), etc. should be taken into account. In the next tutorial it can be seen a range of CAD design tips for 3D printing, depending on the material selected: https://www.sculpteo.com/en/materials/materials-design-guidelines/ And in the next link it can be found more information and more tutorials about how modelling

and preparing a piece for being 3D printed by different CAD software: https://www.sculpteo.com/en/tutorial/ 3.2. Exporting and repairing the STL file When you work designing and printing 3D models, a wide range of formats or types of files are available. Some of them are thought for designing or scanning, but others are associated to 3D printing, such as: STL, OBJ, PLY or FBX, among others. Depending on the modelled piece, on the software, on the 3D printer features, etc., one or another format must be used. In this

guide, in order to unify criteria, it is explained how to export and use the STL file. When the piece is designed and modelled, a format conversion to the “. stl" file is needed. If the piece has been downloaded from a repository, this conversion is frequently already done. However, if free or commercial CAD software has been used this conversion is needed. First of all, what is STL format and how it works is explained briefly: STL stands for "Standard Triangle Language". In simple terms, this format uses linked triangles

for recreating the solid model surface. Depending on the model complexity, more or less 26 triangles (and with more or less size) will be necessary for recreating it, and the greater or the less big the size of the file also will be. In the file, each triangle is defined by a set of parameters, such us the normal vector to the triangle face, and the coordinates (x, y, z) of each triangle vertex. Figure 17: How STL file works. [31] Normally, exporting a CAD design to STL format is as simple as going to the used software

menu and clicking on "Save as..." or in "Export" and choosing STL. Also, depending on the software, some characteristics such as precision or tolerance must be chosen. Hereunder the steps to follow in some CAD programs are shown: Figure 18: Exporting to STL in different software. [32] Sometimes, there are problems during conversion to STL, either because the model is not thought for 3D printing, either because the design in the CAD software has not being made correctly, or either other causes. So, the exported model may have some errors.

27 These errors are of various kinds: holes or gaps, reversed triangles (it means, with the normal vectors in opposite direction), duplicated faces or triangles, faces or triangles that intersect, singular points or faces (out of the model), etc. The digital model reparation is explained in the next step of the production process in 3D printing, because it is very linked to the implementation of analysis to the pieces. 3.3. Testing, orientation, distribution and G-Code This stage of the production process in 3D printing is about the preparation of the pieces or

digital models (previously exported to STL) for being 3D printed. It is about performing the next process, orderly: • To analyze the piece or model: thickness, holes, stability, angles, triangle mesh, etc. • To design the support structures or to automatically generate them. • To choose the infill of the model, both percentage and shape. • To locate the piece on the printing surface (or printing bed) and to select the most appropriate orientation. • To generate the machine code or G-Code. 3.3.1. Analyzing the piece or model

The analysis usually is necessary when pieces are relatively complex, or when the origin of the pieces is not known, or it can be done just if you want to be one hundred per cent that the piece is suitable for being 3D printing. In addition, a good analysis can detect errors in the triangle mesh arisen from the STL conversion. These analyses can be implemented by some software, that also is useful for other purposes or not. Implemented analysis of: - Thickness: Recommended thickness depends on the 3D printing machine (and

frequently on the used technology). Some machines allow to bigger thickness than others. To search the specific machine and to see the allowed thickness should be enough. Generally speaking, for fused deposition modelling (FDM) machines, thickness about 1 millimetre should be considered, approximately. This parameter must not be confused with layer thickness. The parameter here referred is like the thickness of the object itself. This analysis is needed to be done if it is thought that the model needs it.

28 Figure 19: Thickness analysis (1 millimetre) implemented with Meshmixer. [33] - Holes or gaps: The model want to be printed must be perfectly closed, or best said: it must be watertight. This means that the triangular mesh must not have holes or gaps, or what is the same, it must not have vertex or triangle points not joined; every of them must be connected to other triangles. It is highly recommended to perform this test always, before printing, because it can be errors or failures hard to be seen.

- Angles and overhang:  By this analysis it can be found, depending on the selected technology and machine, if the model or piece will need of support structures for being printed. Generally, for FDM printers the minimum allowed inclination angle is 45 degrees. Parts with greater angles will require of support structures. This analysis sometimes is not needed, because lots of pre-printing programs directly calculate the needed supports for the pieces. 29 Figure 20: Angle analysis. [34] - Others: Depending on the used software, more or less analysis will be able to be done.

Also, by certain programs, standard analysis can be done, by them, different kinds of problems may arise. Finally, it is noticeable that many of the used programs for analysing the piece allows, not just to detect errors or problems, but also allow to repair, or what is best, auto repair the model. 3.3.2. Support structures For some technologies (almost all the ones that use plastic), it is necessary that, in order to beat gravity and to print overhang parts (or with internal gaps), support structures are inserted

on these zones. They are usually necessary from 45 degrees (for FDM printers). Figure 21: Support structures. [35] Support structures are usually done by the same material as the piece, although there are 3D printers that print two materials: piece's one and support structures one. With these printers soluble support materials in certain liquids can be used. 30 As support structures are thought just for holding the first layers of the model that are cantilevered or "floating", support structures are built lightly and using less material than for

the piece itself. In addition, they will not mark so much the piece, when they are removed. Most of the available software, either analysis software or either the own software of the printer machine, allow two options: making a design of the support structures, or automatically calculating and inserting these structures. If you do not have enough experience in 3D printing it is recommended let the program automatically calculates the supports. Although it has to be taken into account that it may not optimize the used material. In

addition, a single software may have several different designs for support structures. A good guide for designing, using and calculate how and when using supports can be found in the following link: https://www.3dhubs.com/knowledge-base/supports-3d-printing- technology-overview. In addition, this guide is adapted to different technologies (FDM, SLA, PolyJet, SLS...). Figure 22: Different types of support structures. [36] Figure 23: Differences between a piece with optimized support structures (left) and non-optimized (right).

Differences between printing times can also be seen. [37] 31 3.3.3. Model infill This step can be implemented before inserting the support structures. When we talk about the infill it is about the structure printed inside the object. It means, if we think in the example of a cube, the six external walls will be printed in a solid way, with a certain thickness, but the internal part of the cube will not be solid; you will have to choose the infill percentage, and even the geometrical shape of the infill. With some visual examples

it can be better understood: Figure 24: Different infill percentages. [38] In the figure above are seen two examples of pieces with different infill percentages. Percentage will be chosen (in the pre-printing software) depending on if the piece must have more or less resistance, according to weight. The geometrical pattern of the infill can be also chosen. Some of them are more resistant than others, but generally, the default pattern of the software can be selected. Percentage and pattern shape will be chosen according to several aspects: total weight of the

piece, used material, resistance to be achieved, printing time and sometimes decorative features. In general, the greater the infill percentage, the stronger the printed piece will be, but the longer will take to be printed. A percentage about 15% usually is enough. Hereunder some examples can be seen (on software and on printed pieces): 32 Figure 25: Different infill patterns. [39] 3.3.4. Positioning and orientation To decide the position and orientation of the piece on the printing surface or printing bed is

one of the most important part of the whole process. It is a decision that will have a great impact on the piece quality and properties. It is necessary to take into account that one positioning or another will be done depending on the technology used to print (FDM, SLA, etc.). In this guide it will be explained mostly according to fused filament printers (FDM) One of the most used criteria for choosing position and orientation is using the minimum amount of material (and spending less printing time). This is achieved by minimizing overhang

parts. Consequently, less support structures will be printed, and the piece will be built in less time. However, sometimes quality to achieve is more important, so that orientations that are not optimal in terms of material and printing time, can be chosen. Some tips, in a general way, are: • To center the pieces in the printing surface or bed surface. This will reduce the movements of the printing head (and, consequently, the printing time). Furthermore, it will increase the quality and precision of the piece, because printing platforms are

usually more leveled and calibrated in its central part, and also because if they are heated, heat is greater in the central part. • If you want to print several pieces at once, they should be put together, with a gap between them of about 5 - 15 millimeters. 33 • If there are curved or sloped surfaces, and these parts of the piece are desired to be printed with quality, piece should be positioned so that these surfaces are positioned on XY plane (horizontal plane), or as parallel as possible to this plane. So "stair-

stepping" effect will be avoided, in which curved or sloped surfaces are not smooth. Figure 26: Quality differences in the same piece, according orientation. [40] • Watching the previous picture, if the piece has an inner hole, or a through hole, it would be adequate to put this hole with its axis perpendicular to the printing bed, if a great quality is required in the hole surface. • A very long and plane section printed on the horizontal plane or XY plane may suffer deformation, which means that its outer borders get cold and shrink very quick,

causing the piece to warp upwards. Sometimes, to print these pieces so their longest section is perpendicular to the building plate is convenient. • In a general way, the top surface of a printed piece will have the best finishing. • If we are printing functional pieces, that have to withstand forces and loads, it is much more likely for them to de-laminate and to break when the forces or loads are perpendicular to the layers direction. This can graphically be seen in the next picture: 34 Figure 27: Tension load. [41]

3.3.5. Generating the G-Code. Once all the previous steps have being developed, it is time to generate what is known as G- Code or machine code. This code is the translation of the piece (and all the parameters that have been previously set) into instructions that the machine can understand. Before that, depending on the used software, it is necessary to choose the layer height or layer thickness. This parameter has also a lot of importance and it will have a great impact on the final quality of the surface of the piece. A higher layer height will result on a great

resolution or quality, but also will result on a greater printing time. Figure 28:  Different layers thickness. [42] It is quite important to understand what is more important: aesthetics or a quick and cheap printing. Sometimes, differences between two identical pieces, but with layers height of 100 microns and 200 microns are hard to distinguish. But the 100 microns piece will take the double to print and will cost more. Therefore, it is very important to know what the final use 35 of a piece is. It is also crucial to know the number of curves and angles of the piece, because

the layers height is more visible on these parts than on straight walls. Figure 29: Two different layer heights. [43] To sum up with the layer height matter, it is noticeable that for each machine and technology a certain range of layer height values is available to be chosen. For example, for FDM, a very common range is from 50 to 300 microns (0.05 to 0.3 millimeters). So, at this point the G-Code must be generated, and this can be done by various software. Probably, some of the programs to be used may have already be used in a previous step. The

program cuts the model into horizontal "slices" or layers, generating the path that the machine head will follow. It also calculates the amount of material (weight and meters) and the estimated printing time. Figure 30: Detail of the layers of a piece. [44] 36 Figure 31: Layers and path. [45] With the chosen program, the G-Code is exported and saved, in a SD card or in a pen drive. Or it can be also directly sent to the machine, depending on the software and machine. To sum up this part, it should be taken into account that there are a lot of parameters that can

be changed: wall thickness, printing speeds, printing temperatures and bed temperature, flow, etc. But these are parameters to edit by users with experience, and it is advisable to let them default. 3.4. 3D printing Now the G-Code has being obtained the process of 3D printing can be implemented. There are a few things to consider and to check before printing. For FDM printers, the temperatures of the bed or printing platform and of the extruder must to be checked (the software or the printer do that automatically when you start to print). To

use some kind of lacquer or varnish is also recommendable in order to ease the extraction of the piece. It is advisable to read the instructions to also know how to load the filament on the printer for example, and for further information. Therefore, the G-Code is sent to the machine, and the machine starts to work. 37 3.5. Extracting pieces When the printer has already finished, it is the moment to implement the process of extracting the piece/s. Once again, depending on the machine and mainly, on the technology and used

materials, the extraction processes will vary. For fused deposition modelling machines (FDM), pieces often are removed by hand, or with some tool like a blade. It is also possible to have flexible platforms that ease a lot the extraction. There are even other methods such as using a solvent or applying cold or with dental floss. Figure 32: Extraction. [46] For further information about extraction processes for FDM printers, the following link is given: https://all3dp.com/1/remove-3d-print-from-bed-stuck-glass/

For other technologies, extraction processes changes. Those technologies that use liquid plastic buckets and lasers (for example), or those that use powder materials, have different extraction processes: Figure 33: SLA extraction process. [47] 38 Figure 34: SLS extraction process. [48] 3.6.  Post-processing For a lot of pieces, a finishing process is needed, that once again varies along the kind of technology and kind of machine. For some technologies and machines this process is necessary. Since there are a lot of technologies and machines, here there will exposed the most common

processes, and also the most used for FDM printers. First of all, it is important to note that some of the printed pieces may not need a post- processing step. Or maybe some of them will need just to remove mechanically the support structures. Figure 35: Finishing process. [49] 39 There are a lot of finishing processes and post-processes: • Remove support structures: This can be done mechanically, as it has been said, or by the use of a solvent bath (even water), if the printing material is the adequate one.

Figure 36: Mechanical process. [50] Figure 37: Bath for removing the support structures. [51] • Sanding: It is a process to apply when the support structures have been already removed. Several sanding grades can be chosen. • Polishing: If the piece is wanted to have a "mirror-like" surface it is necessary to polish the piece. It is needed to sand the piece with a sandpaper of number 2000, previously. Then, the powder should be cleaned, and the piece will be polished with a microfiber cloth and a special enamel, which will produce a lasting shine. There are also rotary

sanders and polishers. 40 • Coatings: All the pieces are capable of applying a coating. In the case of paints, it is advisable to apply first a coat layer and then to paint with aerosol, acrylics or airbrushes. Epoxy gels, metal coatings, etc. are also available. Figure 38: Different finishing. [52] There are more finishing processes: shot blasting, smoothing with acetone vapor...

• Curing oven: For other technologies, such as stereolithography, sometimes it is necessary some curing post-process in an ultraviolet rays oven. This process is implemented in order to improve the properties of the piece's material, among others.

SOFTWARE THAT YOU NEED FOR 3D PRINTING There are different software for each form of creation of the 3D object, as well as for each phase of the process. To know which software you have the most affinity and meets your needs, you have to study and evaluate which one is most appropriate for your workflow and

your technical level. The process for obtaining the 3D object is composed of 3 phases: Designing the 3D object, Repairing/Generating of the G-Code and Printing. Figure 39: Process to develop a 3D Model. [54] Scheme 3: Production process for 3D printing.

Programmes for testing, orientating and repairing Before you can print your 3D Model, you need to analyse the 3D model. This will show if any part cannot be printed or if there is a failure. Then it is possible to repair, to decrease or increase the triangles that form the surface that will be printed, and to cut the model in parts if necessary.

G-code is a language in which people tell computerized machine tools how to make something. The "how" is defined by instructions on where to move, how fast to move, and what path to follow. The G-Code can be generated with many different software like Skeinforge, Cura, Slic3r... One of the more used software is Slic3r. It is a necessary tool to convert a 3D model into printing instructions (G-code) for the 3D printer. It cuts the model into horizontal slices (layers), generates toolpaths to fill them and calculates the amount of

material to be extruded. It is possible to scale, rotate, split or cut the object, and also to add support. • Creating the G-Code with Slic3r: 1. Once Slic3r is open, click on the Add button, select the model and open it. Slic3r allows to modify, rotate, scale, cut the model, but if it is ready to be printed the next step is creating the G- Code. To do it, click on  Export G-Code and save it.

[62] 50 5. 3D PRINTING MATERIALS 5.1. Overview When it comes to 3D printing, materials are often one of the most important choice. Earlier AM technologies were making use of certain materials which proved to be non-resistant

enough and were degrading quickly. With time, the knowledge about 3D printing has been extending and has been spreading all over the world. With more people interested and the idea that this technology has the right potential to lead to new innovative ways of manufacturing, further studies and analysis has been conducted and new materials have been created. Today, the 3D printing market offers a variety of choice for what concerns materials. From polymers and metals, to ceramics and composites, many are the materials that have been

created, each of them with its own advantage and disadvantages.  Some examples are visible on 3dhubs.com, a portal which provides 3D printing services on a global level. [63]: • Prototyping Plastic, suitable for fast and cost-effective prototyping; • High Detail Resin, suitable for intricate designs and sculptures; • SLS Nylon, for functional prototypes and end-use parts; • Fiber-Reinforced Nylon, for engineering strong parts; • Rigid Opaque Plastic, for realistic prototypes with high accuracy; • Rubber-Like Plastic, simulating rubber;

• Transparent Plastic, to create see-through parts and prototypes; • Simulated ABS, with high precision and functional molds; • Full Color Sandstone, for photo-realistic models; • Industrial Metals, for prototypes and end-use parts. The industry’s offer is, of course, much wider than what is reported here. For what concerns the demand instead, here the use of a certain material is strongly influenced by not just the type of technology adopted, but also the popularity of 3D printing machines. According to the global 3D printing report for 2016 which collected information from

companies using a variety of 3D printing technologies, the demand for materials in this case 51 shows that metal is leading the competition. Metals are currently being in areas like aerospace and automotive for many reasons. Apart from the high quantity that companies need in this case, 3D printing technology using metals allows to create lightweight components. Weight is, in fact, extremely fundamental for those companies which produce aircraft components, for example. It impacts the quantity of fuel that is used by the aircraft

with very important cuts for what concerns the costs of the airlines. [64] Figure 45: 3DP materials used (%). [65] The graph above shows, instead, the percentage demand of 3D printing materials, as of 2016. Here, the leaders are the polymer materials followed shortly after by metals. This is due to the fact that companies have a lot of experience for what concerns the use of both categories, but much less use is registered for ceramics. Here, instead, the use is much lower. Only 10% of the companies make use of it and this is probably due, in the first place, to its

durability and flexibility. Ceramics don´t allow a certain kind of item to be created like plastics or filaments do. Meanwhile, metals allow them make use of materials like titanium, which has a very strong resistance, steel and aluminium. [66] Today’s trends confirm the path that has been undertaken already. As of late 2017, it has been reported that PLA materials are currently at the top of the chart with a 32% of the total share. It is shortly after followed by ABS filaments, with 14% of the share. Standard Resins

are reported to be the third most used material, with an 8% of the share. At the same time, what the trends are showing is that some materials have been used more than before due to the increase of use of a particular machine and therefore of a specific technology. In this case, for example, PA 12 material has been increasing in its use thanks to the new machines 52 for SLS technology that the market offers currently, alongside with HP’s Multi Jet Fusion Technology. [67] The following are instead some of the indicators regarding the current offer of 3D printing

materials, including the amount of bio-based materials used, as well as the colours and the diameters available, alongside with many other characteristics. Figure 46: 3D Printer Filament Trends: November 2017. [68] 53 5.2. FDM, SLS and SLA 3D Printing Materials According to the latest trends as of late November 2017, and based on the study conducted in chapter 2, the three most used 3D printing technologies are currently: 1. Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM); 2. Selective Laser Sintering (SLS); 3. Stereolithography (SLA).

For what concerns Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM), some of the most popular materials are: • Thermoplastic Filament • PLA: Easy to print, very accurate, low melting point, rigid. Good for most things, not for warm/hot regions. • ABS: Tends to warp, strong and slightly flexible. Used for many mechanical parts. • PETG: Easy to print & accurate, tends to string, good layer adhesion. • TPU: Flexible polymer; ok to print, kind of like stiff rubber. Best used with direct-drive machines. • Nylon: Strong and flexible; special filament for printers exist. Polycarbonate:

Obnoxiously strong, high warp, high temp, bad fumes [Paul Chase, 3D Printing 101. 2016.] Concerning ABS and PLA, there is no limit that one can do of them, for example they can be mixed together. They represent a much better solution to using pure plastic material; this is, in fact, relatively expensive, with a low strength and durability. Final products can usually be distorted easily. Therefore, plastics do not make FDM cost-effective, nor it allows the technology to be applied in functional and load-bearing applications, especially in a large-

scale production. 54 ABS filaments, instead, can take a variety of forms and can be engineered to have many properties. Therefore, they are strong, but also very flexible; they can be sanded and machined, plus acetone can be used to gloss the parts through brushing or dipping them in it. A first comparison between ABS and PLA is that the former filaments are much easier to be recycled, another reason why most of engineers would rather prefer using this kind of material. For what concerns Selective Laser Sintering (SLS), the most

popular materials are represented by the category of polyamides. A very clear example is nylon. Objects, in this case, are created through an extruded filament or through sintered fine powder. The material is, in fact, rigid, strong, but it also flexes under high loads. Polyamides are also considered to be among the cheapest materials. Post-processing prints created with this kind of material allows any kind of polish, dye or paint activities, and giving therefore extended freedom. The negative side of polyamides is that they

absorb humidity quickly and need to be properly stored. As for Stereolithography, plastics and resins are widely used. The market offers a variety of different resins which consist of different backbones and side groups—different combinations of long and short monomers, oligomers, photo initiators, and additives. This provides unique freedom to create various formulations with a wide range of optical, mechanical, and thermal properties, from clear to opaque and colored, flexible to rigid, and tough to heat resistant.

Resins can come in the form of liquid photopolymer materials, which are cured and hardened through ultraviolet (UV) energy. Resins are today one of the best materials in terms of possibility. The technologies that evolved around resins are the ones that offer the Figure 47: Lego bricks from ABS. [69] Figure 48: Polyamide. A strong and flexible material with a high level of detail. [70] 55 highest quality, and this make it a great choice for professional applications, important product presentations, small objects, and so on.

Advantages in the use of resins include suitability for high resolution prints, smooth textures without the need of post-processing them, a wide variety of colours and properties, including transparency and translucency. Disadvantages, instead, include the fact that resins can be irritating and toxic, leading to the need of the correct equipment in order to treat them. Cleaning is also required. Although the material offers a lot of freedom, the printing will require a support structure leading to

an increase of material purchase and therefore it might become costly. This last matter is also influenced by the amount of post-processing steps that are undertaken. 6. LIMITATIONS OF PRINTED OBJECTS In this section we aim to show the limitations of both additive manufacturing and 3D printing in general, as well as the particular limitations of each technology, focusing on the technology Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM). 6.1. Limitations of additive manufacturing and 3D printing Despite the obvious advances that this technology can bring to the industry due to its

indisputable advantages, there are limitations that make additive manufacturing technologies not widely implemented in many sectors. The current limitations are due both to the AM processes themselves, which can still be improved, as well as to auxiliary processes (previous manipulations of material, post- processing, quality control ...) that in many cases condition their viability. The lack of knowledge on how to design the products and how to reorient the companies to successfully integrate these new technologies also influences. [71]

These limitations are undoubtedly surmountable and constitute challenges for research, technological development and innovation, which are currently being addressed by teams of researchers and by many companies around the world. Some of these limitations are the following: 56 Technologies in development: Many of the technologies are in continuous development. Some of them are still in early stages of development. In a few years, a machine may be outdated or outmoded. Availability and cost of the raw material: Getting the supply of materials at some points can

be complicated. Also, some materials are quite expensive, if you are looking for very specific properties. The most basic and cheap material is usually plastic. Initial investment: Desktop FDM printers are usually cheap, but for other technologies, especially if larger machine sizes are sought, the initial investment can be very high. Size of the pieces: The size of the pieces to produce depends on the printing bed. While it is true that many large pieces can be chopped and then joined. Non-profitable mass production: Additive manufacturing and 3D printing are designed for

very short series of pieces (around 1 - 10 units). For longer series, production with these technologies is not profitable. Finishes and precision: In general, getting very good finish and very good precision will be expensive. That is to say, it will be necessary to resort to more expensive technologies and machines. In addition, the parts may require post-processes, other machines and special sub-processes. Obtaining digital files: If specific and highly customized pieces are desired, it is necessary to

possess advanced CAD design knowledge. Most of the time, the repositories of CAD files are not enough. The same goes for the 3D scanner; they are expensive and using it requires certain knowledge. 6.2. Limitations depending on the type of technology Now certain limitations will be specified, grouped according to each type of technology: • Limitations of Fused deposition modeling (FDM). Poor surface finish and low print speed compared to other 3D printing technologies. The typical print size for desktop FDM printers is 20x20x20 cm. Requires support structures to

print parts with lower angles of 45 degrees. The walls must have a minimum of 0.8 mm thickness. The engraved or embossed details can not be more accurate than 0.6 mm wide and 2 mm high. Horizontal "bridges" of more than 10 mm can not be made without the need 57 for supports. In general, holes smaller than 2 mm in diameter can not be printed. To ensure that a part of a piece does not fail when it is printed, the size of this part must be greater than 2 mm. When it comes to printing connection pins, the recommended minimum

diameter is 3 mm. The tolerance (dimensional accuracy) expected is ± 0.5% (± 0.5 mm approximately). • Limitations of selective laser sintering (SLS). The average build volume is around 30x30x30 cm. The finish is slightly granulated to the touch and matt, so if a glossy and smooth finish is desired, post-processing is recommended. The walls must have a minimum of 0.7 mm thickness. Embossed or engraved details should be at least 1mm (width and height). In general, holes with a smaller diameter than 1.5 mm

can not be printed. To remove the support material (un-sintered dust), there must be leak holes in the parts. These must have a minimum diameter of 5 mm. The minimum size of a part of a piece so that the impression does not fail is about 0.8 mm, same for the connection pins. The expected tolerance is approximately ± 0.3% (± 0.3 mm). • Limitations of stereolithography (SLA). SLA printers generally have a much smaller build volume than most FDM printers, with the exception of industrial machines, which can have a print size of 14.5x14.5x14.5 cm. When

the piece is larger, it is better to print it in smaller sections and then assemble them. The cost of the resins is very high (from € 150 / liter). Most parts printed by SLA need a post-curing process in a UV oven. The minimum recommended width of the walls is 0.5 mm (if the wall in question is connected to another element) or 1 mm (if it is not). Support structures are always required for cantilevered parts (this also makes printing more expensive). The engraved or embossed details should be 0.4 mm (width and height). The smallest holes that

can be printed will be approximately 0.5 mm in diameter. To allow the material to come out in hollow pieces, escape holes should be left, which should be approximately 4 mm in diameter. So that an impression does not fail, the minimum size of the parts of the piece will be 0.2 mm. For connection pins, a diameter of 0.5 mm is recommended. The expected tolerance or dimensional accuracy is around ± 0.5% (± 0.15 mm). 58 COMPARATIVE TABLE LIMITATION TECHNOLOGIE NAME DESCRIPTION SKETCH FDM SLA SLS Supported

[72] 6.3. Introduction to the limitations of FDM technology Going a little deeper into the FDM technology here we show some of its limitations in detail and propose some methods that can be implemented in the design stage to minimize the

impact of these limitations when printing an object. BRIDGING Bridging in FDM occurs when the printer is required to print between two supports or anchor points. Because there is no support offered for the initial layer being printed (there is nothing to build upon) and it is required to “bridge” a gap, the material will tend to sag. Bridges occur most often in horizontal axis holes found in the walls of objects or in the top layer (or roof) of hollow parts. 60 One solution to reduce the impact of bridging is to reduce the distance of the bridge, but this

will depend upon the design constraints of the part. Another solution to avoid sagging is to include support. Support offers a temporary build platform for the bridging layer to be built upon. The support material is then removed once the print has been completed. This can leave marks or damage upon the surface where the support was connected to the final part. Key design consideration: Due to the nature of FDM, sagging or marks from support material will always be present to some extent unless the bridge is less than 5mm.

An advanced solution is to split the design into separate parts or consider some form of post processing if a level and smooth surface is required. VERTICAL AXIS HOLES FDM will often print vertical axis holes undersized. The general process for printing a hole diameter and the reason the reduction in diameter occurs is: 1. As the nozzle prints the perimeter of a vertical axis hole, it compresses the newly printed layer down onto the existing build layers to help improve adhesion. 2. The compressing force from the nozzle deforms the extruded round layer shape from a

circle into a wider and flatter shape (see image below). 3. This increases the area of contact with the previously printed layer (improving adhesion), but also increases the width of the extruded segment. 4. The result of this is a decrease in the diameter of the hole that is being printed. Figure 49: FDM printed puzzle piece with support removed showing surface roughness. [73] 61 This can be of particular issue when printing small diameter holes where the effect is greater due to the ratio of hole diameter to nozzle diameter.

The amount of undersize will depend on the printer, the slicing software, the size of the hole, and the material. Often, the reduction in diameter of vertical axis holes is accounted for in the slicing program, but accuracy can vary, and several test prints may be needed to achieve the desired accuracy. If a high level of accuracy is required, drilling the hole after printing may be required. Key design consideration: If the diameter of your vertical axis hole is critical, printing it undersized and then drilling the hole to the correct diameter is recommended.

OVERHANGS Issues with overhang are one of the most common print quality problems relating to FDM. Overhangs occur when the printed layer of material is only partially supported by the layer below. Similar to bridging, the inadequate support provided by the surface below the build layer can result in poor layer adhesion, bulging or curling. Figure 50: The variation in slicer program vs. actual diameter of vertical holes is due to compression of the extruded profile. [74] 62 An overhang can usually be printed with no loss of quality up to 45 degrees, depending on

the material. At 45 degrees, the newly printed layer is supported by 50% of the previous layer. This allows sufficient support and adhesion to build upon. Above 45 degrees, support is required to ensure that the newly printed layer does not bulge down and away from the nozzle. Another issue that occurs when printing overhangs is curling. The newly printed layer becomes increasingly thinner at the edge of the overhang, resulting in differential cooling causing it to deform upward (see the image above).

Key design consideration: Limitations on overhangs can be eliminated by the use of support for wall angles above 45 degrees. For larger overhangs where support is needed, marks will be present on the final surface unless post processed. CORNERS Because the printing nozzle in FDM is circular, corners and edges will have a radius that is equal to the size of the nozzle. This means that these features will never be perfectly square. For sharp edges and corners, the first layers of a print are particularly important. As discussed

above for vertical holes, as the nozzle prints each layer, it compresses the print material down to improve adhesion. For the initial print layer, this creates a flare often called an Figure 51: The effect of increasing overhang angle (in increments of 5 degrees) on print quality. Max. angle shown is 70 degrees. [75] 63 “elephant's foot”. This can impact the ability to assemble FDM parts as this flare protrudes outside the specified dimensions. Another issue that is often present relating to the first print layer of an FDM print is warping.

ABS is more vulnerable to warping due to its high printing temperature when compared to PLA. The base layer is the first layer to be printed and cools as the other hot layers are printed on top. This causes differential cooling and can result in the base layer curling up and away from the build plate as it shrinks and contracts. The addition of a chamfer or radius along the edges of the part that are in contact with the build plate will reduce the impact of these problems. This will also assist in removal of the

component from the build plate once the print has been completed. Key design consideration: If assembly or overall dimensions are critical to the function of an FDM part, include a 45-degree chamfer or radius on all edges touching the build plate. For high precision form & fit testing, other technologies such as SLA or Polyjet are recommended. VERTICAL PINS Vertical pins are often printed in FDM when assembly of parts or alignment is required. Considering that these features are often functional, it is important to understand the size

of vertical pins that FDM can print accurately. Large pins (greater than 5mm diameter) are printed with a perimeter and infill, affording a strong connection to the rest of the print. Smaller diameter pins (less than 5mm diameter) can be made up of only perimeter prints with no infill. This creates discontinuity between the rest of the print and the pin, resulting in a weak connection that is susceptible to Figure 52: Side view of elephant's foot feature that can occur on the base layers of an FDM print. [76]

64 breaking. In a worst-case scenario, small pins may not print at all as there is not enough print material for the newly printed layers to adhere to. Often correct printer calibration (optimal layer height, print speed, nozzle temperature etc.) can reduce the likelihood of small pins failing. The addition of a radius at the base of the pin will eliminate that point as a stress concentration and add strength. For critical pins smaller than 5mm diameter, an off the shelf pin inserted into a printed hole may be the optimal

solution. Key design consideration: If your design contains pins smaller than 5 mm diameter, add a small fillet at the base of the pin. If function is critical, consider including a hole in your design in the location of the pin, drill the hole to the correct size and insert an off the shelf pin. ADVANCED DESIGN Several key aspects to consider when printing with FDM are how to reduce the amount of support required, part orientation and the direction the part is built on the build platform. Splitting up your model

Often, splitting up a model can reduce its complexity, saving on cost and time. Overhangs that require a large amount of support may be removed by simply splitting a complex shape into sections that are printed individually. If desired, the sections can be glued together once the print has been completed. Figure 53: Print of vertical pins with decreasing diameter (from 25 to 5mm) illustrating the upper diameter of the print becoming too small to print accurately. [77] 65 HOLE ORIENTATION Support for holes is best avoided by changing the print orientation. Removal of support in

horizontal axis holes can often be difficult, but by rotating the build direction 90 degrees, the need for support is eliminated. For components with multiple holes in different directions, prioritize blind holes, then holes with the smallest to largest diameter, then criticality of hole size. Figure 54: Splitting a model in order to eliminate the need for support. [78] Figure 55: Re-orientation of horizontal axis holes can eliminate the need for support. [79] 66 BUILD DIRECTION Due to the anisotropic nature of FDM printing, understanding the application of a

component and how it is built are critical to the success of a design. FDM components are inherently weaker in one direction due to layer orientation. The lack of continuous material paths and the stress concentration created by each layer joint contribute to this weakness. Since the layers are printed as a round-ended rectangle, the joints between each layer are actually small valleys. This creates a stress concentration where a crack will want to form. Figure 56: Build direction. [80] Figure 57: Layers with radius. [81]

67 RULES OF THUMB • If a bridge exceeds 5mm, sagging or marks from support material can occur. Splitting the design or post processing can eliminate this issue. • For critical vertical hole diameters, drilling after printing is recommended if high accuracy is desirable. • The addition of support will allow FDM printers to print wall angles greater than 45 degrees. • Include a 45-degree chamfer or radius on all edges of an FDM part touching the build plate. • For applications with small vertical pins, add a small fillet at the base or consider inserting

an off the shelf pin into a printed hole instead. • Splitting a model, re-orientating holes and specifying build direction are all factors that can lower cost, speed up the printing process, and improve the strength and print quality of a design. [82] 7. EXAMPLE In this chapter it is intended to show, by a real example, all the steps to follow for, starting from a model or digital file, getting a real printed piece. The example shown hereunder is about a heritage reproduction project. It arises from the

need to make certain pieces of the Museum of Natural History of Valencia accessible to blind people. Specifically, the project is about the lower part of a tiger jaw. The project begins with the 3D scanning of the original jaw, getting a digital model then. This example will begin from this point. 68 Figure 58: Digital model, result of the 3D scanning. [83] Whatever it is the file format, it has to be exported to STL, as it has been shown in other chapters of this guide. As it can be seen almost simple sight in the previous Figure, the model has several errors

that need to be repaired, like the teeth part, for example. For that, several software can be used. The process of analysis and repairing will be explained here with free-access software. For example: Meshmixer, from Autodesk. Before seeing the process of analysis and reparation of a STL model, it is noted that, this model under consideration was processed by a certain software (Meshlab, specifically) in order to reduce the file size. The model mesh had a very high and excessive number of triangles, so this number was lowed and hence, the file size. This is a step that just a few

times is necessary to implement, so it is just mentioned. For further information about how to reduce the number of triangles of a mesh, and hence the size file, the following link is provided: https://www.shapeways.com/tutorials/polygon_reduction_with_meshlab So, as it was said before, the STL model will be opened with Meshmixer, by clicking on Import. The first thing that can be seen is that the model orientation could not be the adequate one. There is no need to be worry about that. Meshmixer allows you to change it

69 by clicking on Edit > Transform. In addition, we will not print by Meshmixer, so orientation has been adjusted approximately, as can be seen here: Figure 59: Positioning the model in Meshmixer. [84] Thereupon, a general analysis of the defects of the piece is made. For that, Inspector option is used, in Analysis section. Meshmixer detects and shows all the errors in the model or file. The different mistakes are shown in different colours, and they are shown by balls and arrows. Holes in the mesh are displayed in blue, non-manifold points or edges are displayed

in red, and disconnected components or elements with a very little area are displayed in magenta. There are two options now, either repairing the errors one by one by clicking on the "ball", or either clicking on Auto Repair All and repairing everything at once. 70 Figure 60: General analysis in Meshmixer. [85] In this case, the software repairs all the found defects automatically. If not, it is possible to use other software and implement other analysis and reparation process. With Meshmixer it is also possible to perform other kind of analysis such as: thickness,

stability, orientation and positioning on the printing base, etc. So, at this point, the STL model is completely repaired and it is ready for the next step. As it can be seen, the program has closed every hole in the mesh, and it has repaired all the defects. It is noted that the software does this reparation automatically, trying to get close, more or less, to the geometry around the defect. If holes or gaps in the mesh are intended to be repaired with a certain geometry it is needed to use a digital sculpture software. It is

true that Meshmixer has a digital sculpture option, but it will not be explained in this example, because it is not an objective of this guide. 71 Figure 61: Jaw with repaired holes and defects- [86] So now, in Meshmixer, the repaired and fixed model must be exported or saved again in STL format. The next step is to load the file in a software that allows to do, at least, the following things: - Choosing an orientation in the printing bed. Rotating and moving the model. - Scaling the model. - Choosing the quality or layer height.

- Choosing the infill. Density among other issue. - Generating the needed support structures. In addition, with this software the G-Code or machine code will be also generated. There is different free software for doing this. For example, Ultimaker Cura or Slic3r. In this example Cura is used. So, in Cura the repaired model is imported. To configure the software in order to show the printing bed of the machine now is convenient. Cura has a very big data base of commercial 3D printers. If the used machine is not in that data base, it is also possible to create it from

scratch. 72 Figure 62: Model loaded in Cura. [87] This model is going to be scaled to 60%. 0.2 mm. is the chosen layer quality. A grid infill of 15% density is also chosen. Automatically support structures will be generated everywhere, and in order to get a good adhesion for the first layer, "first layer speed" will be set to 20 mm/s. working material is also chosen: PLA. Finally, the G-Code is saved in the device to insert in the printer by clicking on "Save to File". Figure 63: Configuration and parameters of the model in Cura. [88]

73 At this point, it is possible to go to the next step of the process: 3D printing itself. It is needed to go to the machine and, by the appropriated means, to launch the print job. The machine will be left working, and it is recommended to see it from time to time in order to see if everything goes correctly. It is important to say that it is highly recommended to check if the first printed layer is correctly stick to the bed or platform. If not, the following guide is provided: https://www.simplify3d.com/support/print-quality-troubleshooting/#print-not-

sticking-to-the-bed In the next picture the printing sequence is shown, for the given example: Figure 64: Jaw printing sequence. [89] The next step is, obviously, to extract the printed piece. A spatula with rounded edges is used, in order not to scratch and not to damage the printing platform. Figure 65: Piece extraction process. [90] 74 Once the piece has been extracted of the platform, it is time for the post-processing step, consisting on manually and mechanically removing the support structures, and sanding

those parts of the piece that have marks (from support structures, for example). The printing bed should be correctly cleaned for the next print job. Figure 66: Support structures and pliers. [91] Figure 67:  Removing support structures. [92] As mentioned, to sand the marks of the support structures, among others, is very convenient. At the end, the final result of the piece is the following one: 75 Figure 68: Final result. [93] If the result at any point of the printing process, or at the end of the printing process is not

good, or some errors and shrinkages are seen, the following guide can be very helpful, in order to configure some printing parameters or parameters of the printer: https://www.simplify3d.com/support/print-quality-troubleshooting/ 76 SOURCES [1] What is Additive Manufacturing?

Arduino For Beginners Learn about Arduino and the Arduino UNO and how you can integrate this board into your makerspace and coding program.  Make interactive makerspace projects while learning to code and problem solve. More and more makerspaces around the world are looking to add coding and electronics to their maker education programs.  One of the best ways to do this is by integrating an Arduino board into makerspace projects and lessons. We’ve found that a lot of maker educators haven’t taken the plunge into coding or

Arduino because they think programming is scary.  Because of this, we wanted to make sure this tutorial was written for the absolute beginner with no experience whatsoever. This tutorial is a high level view of all the parts and pieces of the Arduino ecosystem.  In future posts, we will take you step by step in creating your first simple Arduino project. What Is Arduino? Arduino is an open source programmable circuit board that can be integrated into a wide variety of makerspace projects both simple and complex.  This board contains

a microcontroller which is able to be programmed to sense and control objects in the physical world.   By responding to sensors and inputs, the Arduino is able to interact with a large array of outputs such as LEDs, motors and displays.  Because of it’s flexibility and low cost, Arduino has become a very popular choice for makers and makerspaces looking to create interactive hardware projects. Arduino was introduced back in 2005 in Italy by Massimo Banzi as a way for non- engineers to have access to a low cost, simple tool for creating hardware

projects.  Since the board is open-source, it is released under a Creative Commons license which allows anyone to produce their own board.  If you search the web, you will find there are hundreds of Arduino compatible clones and variations available but the only official boards have Arduino in it’s name. In the next section, we’re going to discuss a few of the Arduino boards available and how they differ from each other. Types of Arduino Boards Arduino is a great platform for prototyping projects and inventions but can be

confusing when having to choose the right board.  If you’re brand new to this, you might have always thought that there was just one “Arduino” board and that’s it.  In reality, there are many variations of the official Arduino boards and then there are hundreds more from competitors who offer clones.  But don’t worry, we’re going to show you which one to start with later on in this tutorial. Below are a few examples of the different types of Arduino boards out there.  The boards with the name Arduino on them are the official boards but there are also a lot

of really great clones on the market as well.  One of the best reasons to buy a clone is the fact they are generally less expensive than their official counterpart.  Adafruit and Sparkfun for example, sell variations of the Arduino boards which cost less but still have the same quality of the originals.  One word of caution, be careful when buying boards from companies you don’t know. Image credit – Sparkfun.com Another factor to consider when choosing a board is the type of project you are looking to do.  For example, if you want to create a wearable electronic project, you

might want to consider the LilyPad board from Sparkfun.  The LilyPad is designed to be easily sewn into e-textiles and wearable projects.  If your project has a small form factor, you might want to use the Arduino Pro Mini which has a very small footprint compared to other boards.  Check out Sparkfun’s Arduino Comparison Guide for a breakdown and comparison of the top boards out there. Next, we’re going to focus on our favorite Arduino board which we recommend beginners start with. Arduino Uno One of the most popular Arduino boards out there is the Arduino Uno.  While it was

not actually the first board to be released, it remains to be the most actively used and most widely documented on the market.  Because of its extreme popularity, the Arduino Uno has a ton of project tutorials and forums around the web that can help you get started or out of a jam.  We’re big fans of the Uno because of it’s great features and ease of use. Board Breakdown Here are the components that make up an Arduino board and what each of their functions are. 1. Reset Button – This will restart any code that is loaded to the Arduino board

2. AREF – Stands for “Analog Reference” and is used to set an external reference voltage 3. Ground Pin – There are a few ground pins on the Arduino and they all work the same 4. Digital Input/Output –  Pins 0-13 can be used for digital input or output 5. PWM – The pins marked with the (~) symbol can simulate analog output 6. USB Connection – Used for powering up your Arduino and uploading sketches 7. TX/RX – Transmit and receive data indication LEDs 8. ATmega Microcontroller –  This is the brains and is where the programs are

stored 9. Power LED Indicator – This LED lights up anytime the board is plugged in a power source 10. Voltage Regulator – This controls the amount of voltage going into the Arduino board 11. DC Power Barrel Jack  – This is used for powering your Arduino with a power supply 12. 3.3V Pin – This pin supplies 3.3 volts of power to your projects 13. 5V Pin – This pin supplies 5 volts of power to your projects 14. Ground Pins –  There are a few ground pins on the Arduino and they all work the same 15. Analog Pins –  These pins can read the signal from an analog sensor and convert

it to digital Arduino Power Supply The Arduino Uno needs a power source in order for it to operate and can be powered in a variety of ways.  You can do what most people do and connect the board directly to your computer via a USB cable.  If you want your project to be mobile, consider using a 9V battery pack to give it juice.  The last method would be to use a 9V AC power supply. Arduino Breadboard Another very important item when working with Arduino is a solderless breadboard.  This device allows you to prototype your Arduino project without having

to permanently solder the circuit together.  Using a breadboard allows you to create temporary prototypes and experiment with different circuit designs.  Inside the holes (tie points) of the plastic housing, are metal clips which are connected to each other by strips of conductive material. On a side note, the breadboard is not powered on its own and needs power brought to it from the Arduino board using jumper wires.  These wires are also used to form the circuit by connecting resistors, switches and other components together.

Here is a visual of what a completed Arduino circuit looks like when connected to a breadboard. How To Program Arduino Once the circuit has been created on the breadboard, you’ll need to upload the program (known as a sketch) to the Arduino.  The sketch is a set of instructions that tells the board what functions it needs to perform.  An Arduino board can only hold and perform one sketch at a time.  The software used to create Arduino sketches is called the IDE which stands for Integrated Development Environment.  The software

is free to download and can be found at https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software Every Arduino sketch has two main parts to the program: void setup() – Sets things up that have to be done once and then don’t happen again. void loop()  – Contains the instructions that get repeated over and over until the board is turned off. How Everything Works Together Check out our quick Arduino video to see how a breadboard, Arduino, jumper wires and the sketch work together to perform a function.  In this video, we use a

momentary push button switch to blink an LED. Arduino Projects You may be wondering what an Arduino board can do besides blink an LED. Below are some example projects which help to showcase how truly amazing this board is and the capabilities of it.

Arduino shields plug into the top of the Arduino board and can add

capabilities such as WiFi, Bluetooth, GPS and much more.  There are literally hundreds of shields to choose from and here are a few examples.  WiFi Shield  LCD Shield  GPS Logger Shield  MP3 Music Maker Shield  Ethernet Shield  Motor/Stepper/Servo Shield GPS Shield Plugged into Arduino Uno – Sparkfun.com Arduino Sensors If you want your Arduino to sense the world around it, you will need to add a sensor.  There are a wide range of sensors to choose from and they each have a specific purpose.  Below you will find some of the commonly used sensors in

projects.  Distance Ranging Sensor  PIR Motion Sensor  Light Sensor  Degree of Flex Sensor  Pressure Sensor  Proximity Sensor  Acceleration Sensor  Sound Detecting Sensor  RGB and Gesture Sensor  Humidity and Temperature Sensor Examples of Arduino Sensors Electronics Retailers Below are some of our favorite places we tend to go when we need makerspace materials or electronic components.  Adafruit  Sparkfun  Makershed  Radio Shack  Jameco  Digikey  MCM Electronics  Mouser Simple Arduino Projects For Beginners

Arduino Projects In this tutorial, we’re going to help you create a few simple arduino projects that are perfect for beginners.  These basic projects will help you understand how to set up the Arduino software and then connect the components to perform a specific action. If you’re completely brand new to Arduino, make sure you download our free ebook below.  This guide was created for the absolute beginner and will help you to understand the Arduino board along with its parts and components. Tools and Parts Needed

In order to complete the projects in this tutorial, you’ll need to make sure you have the following items.  Arduino Uno Board  Breadboard – half size  Jumper Wires  USB Cable  LED (5mm)  Push button switch  10k Ohm Resistor  220 Ohm Resistor Download The Software At this point, we’re ready to download the free software known as the IDE.  The Arduino IDE is the interface where you will write the sketches that tell the board what to do. You can find the latest version of this software on the Arduino IDE download page.

To install the software, you will need to click on the link that corresponds with your computer’s operating system. Arduino IDE Once the software has been installed on your computer, go ahead and open it up. This is the Arduino IDE and is the place where all the programming will happen. Take some time to look around and get comfortable with it. 1. Menu Bar:  Gives you access to the tools needed for creating and saving Arduino sketches. 2. Verify Button: Compiles your code and checks for errors in spelling or syntax.

3. Upload Button: Sends the code to the board that’s connected such as Arduino Uno in this case.  Lights on the board will blink rapidly when uploading. 4. New Sketch: Opens up a new window containing a blank sketch. 5. Sketch Name: When the sketch is saved, the name of the sketch is displayed here. 6. Open Existing Sketch: Allows you to open a saved sketch or one from the stored examples. 7. Save Sketch: This saves the sketch you currently have open. 8. Serial Monitor:  When the board is connected, this will display the serial

information of your Arduino 9. Code Area: This area is where you compose the code of the sketch that tells the board what to do. 10. Message Area:  This area tells you the status on saving, code compiling, errors and more. 11. Text Console: Shows the details of an error messages, size of the program that was compiled and additional info. 12. Board and Serial Port: Tells you what board is being used and what serial port it’s connected to. Connect Your Arduino Uno At this point you are ready to connect your Arduino to your computer.  Plug one end

of the USB cable to the Arduino Uno and then the other end of the USB to your computer’s USB port. Once the board is connected, you will need to go to Tools then Board then finally select Arduino Uno. Next, you have to tell the Arduino which port you are using on your computer. To select the port, go to Tools then Port then select the port that says Arduino. Arduino Project 1: Blink an LED It’s finally time to do your first Arduino project.  In this example, we are going to make your Arduino board blink an LED.

If you need a refresher on the parts of the Arduino or how a breadboard works, check out our previous tutorial called Arduino For Beginners. Required Parts  Arduino Uno Board  Breadboard – half size  Jumper Wires  USB Cable  LED (5mm)  220 Ohm Resistor Connect The Parts You can build your Arduino circuit by looking at the breadboard image above or by using the written description below.  In the written description, we will use a letter/number combo that refers to the location of the component.  If we mention H19

for example, that refers to column H, row 19 on the breadboard. Step 1 – Insert black jumper wire into the GND (Ground) pin on the Arduino and then in the GND rail of the breadboard row 15 Step 2 – Insert red jumper wire into pin 13 on the Arduino and then the other end into F7 on the breadboard Step 3 – Place the LONG leg of the LED into H7 Step 4 – Place the SHORT leg of the LED into H4 Step 5 – Bend both legs of a 220 Ohm resistor and place one leg in the GND rail around row 4 and other leg in I4

Step 6 – Connect the Arduino Uno to your computer via USB cable Upload The Blink Sketch Now it’s time to upload the sketch (program) to the Arduino and tell it what to do.  In the IDE, there are built-in example sketches that you can use which make it easy for beginners. To open the blink sketch, you will need to go to File > Examples > Basics > Blink Now you should have a fully coded blink sketch that looks like the image below. Next, you need to click on the verify button (check mark) that’s located in the top left

of the IDE box.  This will compile the sketch and look for errors.  Once it says “Done Compiling” you are ready to upload it.  Click the upload button (forward arrow) to send the program to the Arduino board. The built-in LEDs on the Arduino board will flash rapidly for a few seconds and then the program will execute.  If everything went correctly, the LED on the breadboard should turn on for a second and then off for a second and continue in a loop. Congrats!  You just completed your first Arduino project.   Troubleshooting – If you

ran into a problem don’t give up, check out the troubleshooting section at the end for common ways to fix problems. Change The Code Before we go to the next project, lets change some of the code in the “Blink” sketch to make it do something different.  Playing around with the sketch will help you start to learn how the code controls the board. Keep the Arduino board connected and change the delay portion of the code from (1000) to (200).  Click the verify button on the top left of the IDE and then click

upload.  This should make the LED on the breadboard blink faster. NOTE – Arduino measures time in milliseconds and 1000 milliseconds = 1 second.  The original code (1000) turns on the LED for 1 second and then off for 1 second.  By adjusting the code from (1000) to (200) it shortens the time between on and off which makes it blink faster. Arduino Project 2: LED w/ Switch Now it’s time to talk switches and how they can be incorporated into Arduino projects.  A switch is a electrical component that completes a circuit when pushed and

breaks the circuit when released.  In this project, we will be using a small pushbutton switch to control an LED. Required Parts  Arduino Uno Board  Breadboard – half size  Jumper Wires  USB Cable  LED (5mm)  Push button switch  10k Ohm Resistor  220 Ohm Resistor Connect The Parts You can build your Arduino circuit by looking at the breadboard image above or by using the written description below.  In the written description, we will use a letter/number combo that refers to the location of the component.  If we mention H19

for example, that refers to column H, row 19 on the breadboard. Step 1 – Connect the blue jumper wire from the GND on the Arduino to the GND rail (blue line) on the breadboard near A13 Step 2 – Connect the blue jumper wire from the GND rail on the breadboard near A17 to H19 Step 3 – Connect the red jumper wire from the power rail on the breadboard around row A27 to H26 Step 4 – Connect the green jumper wire from pin 2 on Arduino to J24 on the breadboard Step 5 – Place one leg of a 10k Ohm resistor in G19 and the other leg in G24

Step 6 – Place the pushbutton switch into F24, F26, E24 and E26 Step 7 – Place one leg of a 220 Ohm resistor in D5 and the other leg in G5 Step 8 – Insert the short leg of the LED in the GND rail around A5 and the long leg in B5 Step 9 – Connect the black jumper wire from pin 13 on the Arduino to I5 on the breadboard Step 10 – Connect the red jumper wire from 5V on the Arduino to power rail (+) near A8 Step 11 – Connect the Arduino Uno to your computer via USB cable Upload The Switch Sketch Now it’s time to upload the sketch to the Arduino that will allow us to use a

switch.  As with the blink sketch, there are example programs already loaded in the Arduino IDE that we will be using. In order to use a switch, we have to load the file called “Button” which can be found here:  File > Examples > Digital > Button Now you should have a fully coded button sketch that looks like the image below. Next, you need to click on the verify button (check mark) that’s located in the top left of the IDE box.  Once it says “Done Compiling” you are ready to upload it.  Click the

upload button (forward arrow) to send the program to the Arduino board. Press the button switch on the breadboard and you should be able to turn on and off the LED as shown in this Youtube video. Troubleshooting If you are having any problems with the projects we did, make sure the following has been checked. 1. Verify the LED is actually functional.  Use a 3v coin cell battery and connect the LONG leg of the LED to the (+) and SHORT leg to the (-) of the battery. 2. Verify the correct leg of the LED is connected properly.  LONG leg to positive

and SHORT leg to negative. 3. Make sure the Arduino IDE shows the correct board.  Go to Tools > Board then select Arduino Uno. 4. Make sure the Arduino IDE shows the correct port.   Go to Tools > Port then select the port that says Arduino. 5. Verify all component connections are secure with the Arduino board and breadboard.

162 00 BECOME EXTRAORDINARY Everyone, every day, uses technology. Most of us leave the programming to engineers because we think coding and electronics are complicated and difficult; actually, they can be fun and exciting activities. Thanks to Arduino, designers, artists, hobbyists and students of all ages are learning to create things that light up, move, and respond to people, animals, plants, and the rest of the world. Over the years Arduino has been used as the “brain” in thousands of projects, one more creative than the last. A worldwide

community of makers has gathered around this open-source platform, moving from personal computing to personal fabrication, and contributing to a new world of participation, cooperation and sharing. Arduino is open and simple. It’s founded on lessons we’ve learned teaching our own classes: if you start with the assumption that learning to make digital technologies is simple and accessible, you can make it so. Suddenly electronics and code become creative tools that anyone can use – like brushes and paint.

This book walks you through the basics in a hands-on way, with creative projects you build by learning. Once you’ve mastered the basics, you’ll have a palette of software and circuits that you can use to create something beautiful, and make someone smile with what you invent. WELCOME TO ARDUINO! ARDUINO MAKES IT AS EASY AS POSSIBLE TO PROGRAM TINY COMPUTERS CALLED MICROCONTROLLERS, WHICH ARE WHAT MAKE OBJECTS INTERACTIVE You are surrounded by dozens of them every day: they are embedded in timers,

thermostats, toys, remote controls, microwave ovens, even some toothbrushes. They just do one specific task, and if you hardly notice them – which is often the case – it’s because they are doing it well. They have been programmed to sense and control activity using sensors and actuators. Sensors listen to the physical world. They convert energy that you give off when you press buttons, or wave your arms, or shout, into electrical signals. Buttons and knobs are sensors that you touch with your fingers, but there are many other

kinds of sensors. Actuators take action in the physical world. They convert electrical energy back into physical energy, like light and heat and movement. Microcontrollers listen to sensors and talk to actuators. They decide what to do based on a program that you write. Microcontrollers and the electronics you attach to them are just the skeleton of your projects, though. You’ll need to bring skills you probably already have to put some flesh on the bones. For example, in one of the projects we suggest, you’ll make an arrow and attach it

to a motor, and put them both in a box with a knob, so you can make a meter to tell people whether you’re busy or not. In another, you’ll put some lights and a tilt switch on a cardboard frame to make an hourglass. Arduino can make your projects responsive, but only you can make them beautiful. We’ll provide some suggestions along the way as to how you might do that. Arduino was designed to help you get things done. To make that happen, we kept the background material on programming and electronics to a minimum. If you

decide you want to know more about these aspects, there are lots of good guides available. We’ll provide a couple of references, and you can find more online at: arduino.cc/starterkit Arduino Uno - The microcontroller develop­ ment board that will be at the heart of your projects. It’s a simple computer, but one that has no way for you to interact with it yet. You will be building the circuits and interfaces for interaction, and telling the microcontroller how to interface with other components.

+ - + - + - + - Battery Snap - Used to connect a 9V battery to power leads that can be easily plugged into a breadboard or your Arduino. Breadboard - A board on which you can build electronic circuits. It’s like a patch panel, with rows of holes that allow you to connect wires and components together. Versions that re­ quire soldering are available, as well as the sol­ der-less type used here. Capacitors - These components store and re­ lease electrical energy in a circuit. When the circuit’s voltage is higher than what is stored in

the capacitor, it allows current to flow in, giv­ ing the capacitor a charge. When the circuit’s voltage is lower, the stored charge is released. Often placed across power and ground close to a sensor or motor to help smooth fluctuations in voltage. DC motor - Converts electrical energy into me­ chanical energy when electricity is applied to its leads. Coils of wire inside the motor become magnetized when current flows through them. + PARTS IN YOUR KIT 6 Welcome to Arduino! Introduction These magnetic fields attract and repel mag­

nets, causing the shaft to spin. If the direction of the electricity is reversed, the motor will spin in the opposite direction. Diode - Ensures electricity only flows in one di­ rection. Useful when you have a motor or other high current/voltage load in your circuit. Di­ odes are polarized, meaning that the direction that they’re placed in a circuit matters. Placed one way, they allow current to pass through. Placed the other way, they block it. The anode side generally connects to the point of higher

energy in your circuit. The cathode typically connects to the point of lower energy, or to ground. The cathode is usually marked with a band on one side of the component’s body. Gels (red, green, blue) - These filter out differ­ ent wavelengths of light. When used in con­ junction with photoresistors, they cause the sensor to only react to the amount of light in the filtered color. H-bridge - A circuit that allows you to control the polarity of the voltage applied to a load, usually a motor. The H-bridge in the kit is an in­

tegrated circuit, but it could also be construct­ ed with a number of discrete components. Jumper wires - Use these to connect compo­ nents to each other on the breadboard, and to the Arduino. Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs) - A type of diode that illuminates when electricity passes through it. Like all diodes, electricity only flows in one direction through these components. You’re probably familiar with these as indicators on a variety of electronic devices. The anode, which typically connects to power, is usually the long­

er leg, and the cathode is the shorter leg. Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) - A type of alpha­ numeric or graphic display based on liquid crys­ tals. LCDs are available in a many sizes, shapes, and styles. Yours has 2 rows with 16 characters each. - + - + 7 Resistors - Resist the flow of electrical energy in a circuit, changing the voltage and current as a result. Resistor values are measured in ohms (represented by the Greek omega char­ acter: Ω). The colored stripes on the sides of resistors indicate their value (see resistor color

code table). Optocoupler - This allows you to connect two circuits that do not share a common power supply. Internally there is a small LED that, when illuminated, causes a photoreceptor in­ side to close an internal switch. When you ap­ ply voltage to the + pin, the LED lights and the internal switch closes. The two outputs replace a switch in the second circuit. Piezo - An electrical component that can be used to detect vibrations and create noises. Photoresistor - (also called a photocell, or light-

dependent resistor). A variable resistor that changes its resistance based on the amount of light that falls on its face. Potentiometer - A variable resistor with three pins. Two of the pins are connected to the ends of a fixed resistor. The middle pin, or wiper, moves across the resistor, dividing it into two halves. When the external sides of the poten­ tiometer are connected to voltage and ground, the middle leg will give the difference in voltage as you turn the knob. Often referred to as a pot.

Pushbuttons - Momentary switches that close a circuit when pressed. They snap into bread­ boards easily. These are good for detecting on/ off signals. Male header pins - These pins fit into female sockets, like those on a breadboard. They help make connecting things much easier. 8 Welcome to Arduino! Introduction USB Cable - This allows you to connect your Arduino Uno to your personal computer for programming. It also provides power to the Ar­ duino for most of the projects in the kit. Temperature sensor - Changes its voltage out­

put depending on the temperature of the com­ ponent. The outside legs connect to power and ground. The voltage on the center pin changes as it gets warmer or cooler. Tilt sensor - A type of switch that will open or close depending on its orientation. Typically they are hollow cylinders with a metal ball in­ side that will make a connection across two leads when tilted in the proper direction. Transistor - A three legged device that can op­ erate as an electronic switch. Useful for control­ ling high current/high voltage components like

motors. One pin connects to ground, another to the component being controlled, and the third connects to the Arduino. When the com­ ponent receives voltage on the pin connected to an Arduino, it closes the circuit between the ground and the other component. Servo motor - A type of geared motor that can only rotate 180 degrees. It is controlled by sending electrical pulses from your Arduino. These pulses tell the motor what position it should move to. 9 TABLE OF SYMBOLS UNCONNECTED WIRES LED DIODE

PUSHBUTTON PIEZO TILT SWITCH POLARIZED CAPACITOR MOSFET TRANSISTOR CAPACITOR MOTOR BATTERY RESISTOR GROUND PHOTO RESISTOR POTENTIOMETER In this book we will show you circuits both with realistic illustrations and with schematic diagrams. Illustrations will give you an idea of what the breadboard might look like in one possible implementation of the project. Schematics, instead, use symbols to capture the essence of circuits: they present the components and the ways they are connected in a clear, succinct, and unambiguous form, but not

their physical organization. Schematics and schematic symbols are how we communicate about circuits. As you explore the world of electronics you will discover that some books and websites only provide schematic diagrams, so learning to read circuits this way is a valuable skill. Here are the symbols we will be using throughout the book. CONNECTED WIRES THE BOARD 11 USB port Used for powering your Arduino Uno, uploading your sketches to your Arduino, and for communicating with your Arduino sketch (via Serial.

Can accept voltages between 7-12V. Reset Button Resets the ATmega microcontroller. TX and RX LEDs These LEDs indicate communi­ cation between your Arduino and your computer. Expect them to flicker rapidly during sketch upload as well as during serial communication. Useful for debugging. Pin 13 LED The only actuator built-it to your Arduino Uno. Besides

being a handy target for your first blink sketch, this LED is very useful for debugging. Power LED Indicates that your Arudino is receiving power. Useful for debugging. Analog in Use these pins with analogRead(). GND and 5V pins Use these pins to provide +5V power and ground to your circuits. Digital pins Use these pins with digital­ Read(), digitalWrite(), and analogWrite(). analogWrite() works only on the pins with the PWM symbol. Your Starter Kit includes a pre- cut, easy-to-assemble wooden base that will make working on

all your projects – whether they are from this book or not – even easier. To build it, take the wood sheet out of the box and follow the instructions on the right. Be careful to use only the parts that are shown, but don’t misplace any of the other pieces: you’ll need them for some of the projects later. Let’s start! ❶ Take the wood sheet and carefully separate the pieces. ❹ Secure your Arduino Uno to the base using 3 screws. Be careful not to overtightens. 12 Welcome to Arduino! Introduction ❷ Go on until you’ve separated all the parts.

❸ Place the pieces marked with an “A” into the holes in the corners, in order to create the feet of the base. ❺ Carefully peel the backing from the breadboard. ❻ Stick the breadboard on the wooden sheet, next to the Arduino UNO. 13 9V battery Small light source like a flashlight Conductive material like aluminum foil or copper mesh Colored paper Scissors An old CD or DVD Tape and glue THINGS YOU NEED TO SUPPLY - A box that you can make holes into Basic tools like a screwdriver 9V battery powered component

Any battery powered electronic device with at least one switch or pushbutton that you’re will­ ing to hack into will do the job. Soldering iron and solder (necessary only in Project  15) 14 Welcome to Arduino! Introduction WELCOME TO ARDUINO! BEFORE YOU START CONTROLLING THE WORLD AROUND YOU, YOU’LL NEED TO DOWNLOAD THE IDE TO PROGRAM YOUR BOARD The Arduino IDE allows you to write programs and upload them to your Arduino. Download the latest version of the IDE from: arduino.cc/download Have your Arduino board and USB cable near your computer.

Don’t plug them in just yet. Follow the appropriate procedures in the next pages for Windows, Mac OS X or Linux. The online version of this guide is available at: arduino.cc/guide SETTING UP When the download of the IDE finishes, unzip the downloaded file. Make sure to preserve the folder structure. Double-click the folder to open it. There should be a few files and sub-folders inside. Connect the Arduino to your computer with the USB cable. Your Arduino will automatically draw power from either the USB con­

nection to the computer or an external power supply. The green power light (labeled PWR) should turn on. Windows should initiate its driver installation process when the board is plugged in. Your computer won’t be able to find the driv­ ers by itself, so you’ll need to tell it where they are located. In the Device Manager, you should now see a port listing similar to “Arduino UNO (COM4)”. Congratulations! You've installed the Arduino IDE on your computer. — — Click on the Start Menu and open the Control Panel.

— — Navigate to “System and Security”. Open the Device Manager. — — In Windows XP, look for the listing named "Ports (COM & LPT)" and right click on the "USB device" port; in Vista and Windows 7, right click on "Unknown device" under "Other devices". — — Choose "Update Driver Software". — — On Windows XP and Windows 7, you will be asked whether to install automatically or "with a path". Chose the second option, "with a path". On Windows Vista proceed directly to the next step. — — Select the “Browse my computer for Driver software” option.

— — Navigate to the folder you unzipped in the earlier step. Locate and select the “Drivers” folder in the main Arduino folder (not the “FTDI USB Drivers” sub-directory). Press “OK” and “Next” to proceed. — — If you are prompted with a warning dialog about not passing Windows Logo testing, click “Continue Anyway”. — — Windows now will take over the driver installation. WINDOWS INSTALLATION Online version arduino.cc/windows ❶ ❷ ❸ INSTRUCTION FOR: WINDOWS 7, VISTA, AND XP 16 Introduction Setting Up

When the download of the IDE finished, double-click the .zip fle. This will expand the Arduino application. Copy the Arduino application into the Applications folder, or wherever else you wish to install the software. Connect the board to the computer with the USB cable. The green power LED (labeled PWR) should turn on. You do not need to install any drivers to work with the board. Depending on the version of OS X that you are running, you might get a dialog box asking if you wish to open the “Network

Preferences”. Click the “Network Preferences...” button, and then click “Apply”. The Uno will show up as “Not Configured”, but it is still working. You can quit the System Preferences. Congratulations! You have Arduino all set up and you're ready to start making projects. MAC OS X INSTALLATION Online version arduino.cc/mac ❶ ❷ ❸ ❹ ❺ INSTRUCTION FOR: OS X 10.5 AND LATER If you’re using Linux, please visit the website for instructions: arduino.cc/linux LINUX INSTALLATION 17 Fig. 1 COMMUNICATING WITH THE

ARDUINO Now that you’ve installed the Arduino IDE and made sure your computer can talk to the board, it’s time to make sure you can up­ load a program. Double-click the Arduino application to open it. If the IDE loads in the wrong language, you can change this in the application preferences. Look for “Language Support” on this page for de­ tails: arduino.cc/ide Navigate to the LED blink example sketch ('sketch' is what Ar­ duino programs are called). It's located under: FILE > EXAMPLES > 01.BASICS > BLINK

A window with some text in it should have opened. Leave the window be for now, and select your board under: TOOLS > BOARD menu 18 Introduction Setting Up Choose the serial port your Arduino is connected to from the TOOLS > SERIAL PORT menu. — — On Windows. This is likely to be the COM with the highest number. There is no harm in guessing wrong, and if it doesn’t work, try the next one. To find out, you can disconnect your Arduino board and re-open the menu; the entry that disappears should be the Arduino board. Reconnect the board and select

To upload the Blink sketch to your Arduino, press the UPLOAD toggle in the top left corner of the window. See Fig. 1. ❶ ❷ ❸ ❹ ❺ Fig. 2 ADDITIONAL INFORMATION 19 You should see a bar indicating the progress of the upload near the lower left corner of the Arduino IDE, and the lights labeled TX and RX on the Arduino board will be blinking. If the upload is successful,

the IDE will display the message DONE UPLOADING. A few seconds after the upload has completed, you should see the yellow LED with an L next to it start blinking. See Fig. 2. If this is the case, congratulations! You’ve successfully pro­ grammed the Arduino to blink its onboard LED! Sometimes your brand new Arduino is already programmed with the Blink sketch, so you can’t tell if you are truly in control. If this is the case, change the delay time by changing the number in the parenthesis to 100, and upload the Blink sketch again. Now the

LED should blink much faster. Congratulations! You really are in control! Now it’s time to move on to Project  1. (You needn’t save any changes you have made.) If you have problems with any of the steps outlined above, please see the troubleshooting suggestions: arduino.cc/trouble While you’re getting ready to build your projects, you can look at the following page for additional information about the Arduino’s programming environment: arduino.cc/ide You might also want to look at: — — the examples for using various sensors and actuators

Electrical energy flows through conductors, like wire. You can convert electrical energy into other forms of energy to do something interesting, like turn on a light or make some noise out of a speaker. The components you might use to do this, like speakers or light bulbs, are electri­

cal transducers. Transducers change other types of energy into electrical energy and vice versa. Things that convert other forms of energy into electrical energy are often called sensors, and things that convert electrical energy into other forms of energy are sometimes called actuators. You will be building circuits to move electricity through different components. Circuits are closed loops of wire with a power source (like a battery) and something to do something useful with the energy, called a load.

In a circuit, electricity flows from a point of higher potential energy (usually re­ ferred to as power or +) to a point of lower potential energy. Ground (often repre­ sented with a - or GND) is generally the point of least potential energy in a circuit. In the circuits you are building, electricity only flows in one direction. This type of circuit is called direct current, or DC. In alternating current (AC) circuits electricity changes its direction 50 or 60 times a second (depending on where you live). This

is the type of electricity that comes from a wall socket. There are a few terms you should be familiar with when working with electri­ cal circuits. Current (measured in amperes, or amps; with the A symbol) is the amount of electrical charge flowing past a specific point in your circuit. Voltage (measured in volts; with the V symbol) is the difference in energy between one point in a circuit and another. And finally, resistance (measured in ohms; with the Ω symbol) is how much a component resists the flow of electrical energy.

GET TO KNOW YOUR TOOLS Time: 30 MINUTES Level: Discover: basic electrical theory, how a breadboard works, components in series and parallel 21 One way to imagine this is to think about a rockslide going down a cliff, as shown in Fig. 1. The higher the cliff, the more energy the rocks will have when they hit the bottom. The height of the cliff is like the voltage in a circuit: the higher the voltage at the energy source, the more energy you have to use. The more rocks you have, the more energy is being carried down the cliff. The num­

ber of rocks is like the current in an electrical circuit. The rocks go through bushes on the side of the cliff, losing some energy in the process; the energy is used up to crush the bushes. The bushes are like resistors in a circuit, offering resistance to the electrical flow and converting it into other forms of energy. There needs to be a complete path from the energy source (power) to the point of least energy (ground) to make a circuit. If there’s no path for the energy to travel, the circuit won’t work.

All the electrical energy gets used up in a circuit by the com­ ponents in it. Each component converts some of the energy into another form of energy. In any circuit, all of the voltage is con­ verted to another form of energy (light, heat, sound, etc.). The flow of current at a specific point in a circuit will always be the same coming in and going out. Electrical current will seek the path of least resistance to ground. Given two possible paths, more of the electrical current will go down the path with less resistance. If you have a connec­

tion that connects power and ground together with no resist­ ance, you will cause a short circuit, and the current will try to follow that path. In a short circuit, the power source and wires convert the electrical energy into light and heat, usually as sparks or an explosion. If you’ve ever shorted a battery and seen sparks, you know how dangerous a short circuit can be.

The one that comes in your kit is solderless, so named because you don’t have to solder anything together, sort of like LEGO in electronic form.

Fig. 4 24 Get to Know Your Tools Project 01 Throughout these projects, you’ll see two views of circuits: one in breadboard view (like in Fig. 5), that looks like the stuff in your kit. The other is a schematic view (like in Fig. 6), which is a more abstract way of showing the relationships between components in a circuit. Schematics don’t always show where components are placed rela­ tive to each other, but they show how they are connected. + - + - + - + - CIRCUIT DRAWINGS Circuit illustration. Fig. 5

Schematic view Fig. 6 An LED, or light-emitting diode, is a component that converts electrical energy into light energy. LEDs are polarized components, which means they only allow electricity to flow through them in one direction. The longer leg on the LED is called an anode, it will connect to power. The shorter leg is a cathode and will con­ nect to ground. When voltage is applied to the anode of the LED, and the cathode is connected to ground, the LED emits light. A resistor is a component that resists the flow of electrical energy (see the com­

ponents list for an explanation on the colored stripes on the side). It converts some of the electrical energy into heat. If you put a resistor in series with a com­ ponent like an LED, the resistor will use up some of the electrical energy and the LED will receive less energy as a result. This allows you to supply components with the amount of energy they need. You use a resistor in series with the LED to keep it from receiving too much voltage. Without the resistor, the LED would be brighter for a few moments, but quickly burn out.

A switch interrupts the flow of electricity, breaking the circuit when open. When a switch is closed, it will complete a circuit. There are many types of switches. The ones in your kit are called momentary switches, or pushbuttons, because they are only closed when pressure is applied. 25 YOUR FIRST COMPONENTS The switch Fig. 7 - CATHODE These two pins of a switch are connected to each other These two are not.

Arduino is just the power source for this circuit; in later projects, you'll connect its input and output pins to control more complex circuits. 27 You’re going to use the Arduino in this project, but only as a source of power. When plugged into a USB port or a 9-volt bat­ tery, the Arduino will provide 5 volts between its 5V pin and its

ground pin that you can use. 5V = 5 volts, you’ll see it written this way a lot. If your Arduino is connected to a battery or computer via USB, unplug it before building the circuit! Connect a red wire to the 5V pin on the Arduino, and put the other end in one of the long bus lines in your breadboard. Con­ nect ground on the Arduino to the adjacent bus line with a black wire. It’s helpful to keep your wire color consistent (red for pow­ er, black for ground) throughout your circuit. Now that you have power on your board, place your switch

across the center of the board. The switch will sit across the center in one direction. The bend in the legs of the switch point to the center of the board. Use a 220-ohm resistor to connect power to one side of the switch. The illustrations in this book use 4 bands. Your kit may have a mix of 4 and 5 band resistors. Use the illustration on the side to check for the right one for this project. Look at page 41 for a detailed explanation of the color codes for resistors. On the other side of the switch, connect the anode (long leg)

of the LED. With a wire connect the cathode (short leg) of the LED to ground. When you’re ready, plug the USB cable into the Arduino. Once everything is set to go, press the button. You should see the LED light up. Congratulations, you just made a circuit! Once you’ve tired of pressing the button to turn the light on, it’s time to shake things up by adding a second button. USE IT You’ll be placing components on the breadboard in series and in parallel. Components in series come one after another.

Components in parallel run side by side. ❶ ❷ ❸ ❹ 28 Get to Know Your Tools Project 01 Once you’ve removed your power source add a switch next to the one already on your breadboard. Wire them together in series as shown in Fig. 10. Connect the anode (long leg) up the LED to the second switch. Connect the LED cathode to ground. Power up the Arduino again: now to turn on the LED, you need to press both switches. Since these are in series, they both need to be closed for the circuit to be completed.

Series circuit COMPONENTS IN SERIES COME ONE AFTER ANOTHER + - + - + - + - ALWAYS REMOVE POWER BEFORE CHANGING ANYTHING IN YOUR CIRCUIT The two switches are in series. This means that the same electrical current flows through both of them, so that they both have to be pressed for the LED to light up. Fig. 10 Fig. 11 These two elements are in series 29 Now that you’ve mastered the art of things in series, it’s time to wire up switches in parallel. Keep the switches and LED where they are, but remove the connection between the two

switches. Wire both switches to the resistor. Attach the other end of both switches to the LED, as shown in Fig. 12. Now when you press either button, the circuit is completed and the light turns on. + - + - + - + - Parallel circuit COMPONENTS IN PARALLEL RUN SIDE BY SIDE These two switches are in parallel. This means that the electrical current is split between them. If either switch is pressed, the LED will light up. Fig. 12 Fig. 13 These two elements are in parallel V I R You can use this circle to

remember the relationships between voltage, current, and resistance. Put your finger over any of the three, and you see how it relates to the other two. Current, voltage, and resistance are all related. When you change one of these in a circuit, it affects the others. The rela­ tionship between them is known as Ohm's Law, named for Georg Simon Ohm, who discovered it. VOLTAGE (V) = CURRENT (I) * RESISTANCE (R) When measuring amperage in the circuits you’ll be building, values will be in the milliamp range. That’s thousandths of one amp.

V I R V I R I = V / R R = V / I V I R V = I * R In the circuit shown in Fig. 5, you’re supplying 5 volts. The resistor offers 220 ohms resistance. To find the amperage used by the LED, replace the values in the equa­ tion. You should have 5=I*220. Dividing both sides of the equation by 220, you’ll find that I = .023. That’s 23 thousandths of an amp, or 23 milliamps (23 mA) used by the LED. That value is just about the maximum you can safely use with these LEDs, which is why you used a 220-ohm resistor.

You can expand this project in a number of ways, either by creating your own switch (two pieces of foil with wire work well), or creating a combination of switches and LEDs in parallel and series. What happens when you put three or four LEDs in series? What happens when they are in parallel? Why does it behave the way it does? A multimeter is a tool that can verify the amount of resistance, current, and volt­ age in your circuit. While it’s not necessary to use one for these projects, it can be a useful part of any engineer’s toolbox. There’s a good description of how to use

With some components like LEDs, resistors and switches, you created the simplest interactive system: a user presses the button, the lights turn on. These fundamentals of working with electronics will be referenced and expanded upon in the upcoming projects.

10 KILOHM RESISTOR SWITCH 220 OHM RESISTOR LED INGREDIENTS 02 Time: 45 MINUTES Level: YOUR ARDUINO IS GOING TO STAR IN A SCIENCE FICTION MOVIE Now that you’ve got the basics of electricity under control, it’s time to move onto controlling things with your Arduino. In this project, you’ll be building something that could have been a spaceship interface in a 1970s science fiction movie. You’ll make a cool control panel with a switch and lights that turn on when you press the switch. You can decide whether the lights mean “Engage Hyperdrive” or “Fire the

lasers!”. A green LED will be on, until you press a button. When the Arduino gets a signal from the button, the green light will turn off and 2 other lights will start blinking. The Arduino’s digital pins can read only two states: when there is voltage on an input pin, and when there’s not. This kind of input is normally called digital (or sometimes binary, for two-states). These states are commonly referred to as HIGH and LOW. HIGH is the same as saying “there’s voltage here!” and LOW means “there’s no voltage on this pin!”. When you turn an OUTPUT pin HIGH using a

command called digitalWrite(), you’re turning it on. Measure the voltage between the pin and ground, you’ll get 5 volts. When you turn an OUTPUT pin LOW, you’re turning it off. The Arduino’s digital pins can act as both inputs and outputs. In your code, you’ll configure them depending on what you want their function to be. When the pins are outputs, you can turn on components like LEDs. If you configure the pins as inputs, you can check if a switch is being pressed or not. Since pins 0 and 1 are used

for communicating with the computer, it’s best to start with pin 2. SPACESHIP INTERFACE Builds on project: 1 Discover: digital input and output, your first program, variables 33 + - + - + - + - BUILD THE CIRCUIT Fig. 1 Fig. 2 34 Spaceship Interface Project 02 Wire up your breadboard to the Arduino’s 5V and ground connections, just like the previous project. Place the two red LEDs and one green LED on the breadboard. Attach the cathode (short leg) of each LED to ground through a 220-ohm resistor.

Connect the anode (long leg) of the green LED to pin 3. Connect the red LEDs’ anodes to pins 4 and 5, respectively. Place the switch on the breadboard just as you did in the previous project. Attach one side to power, and the other side to digital pin 2 on the Arduino. You’ll also need to add a 10k-ohm resistor from ground to the switch pin that connects to the Arduino. That pull-down resistor connects the pin to ground when the switch is open, so it reads LOW when there is no voltage coming in through the switch.

❶ ❷ ❶ Fold the pre-cut paper as shown. ❷ Place the folded paper over the breadboard. The three LEDs and pushbutton will help keep it in place. 35 You can cover the breadboard the template provided in the kit. Or you can deco­ rate it to make your own launch system. The lights turning on and off mean noth­ ing by themselves, but when you put them in a control panel and give them labels, they gain meaning. What do you want the green LED to mean? What do the flash­ ing red LEDs mean? You decide! Every Arduino program has two main functions. Functions are

parts of a computer program that run specific commands. Func­ tions have unique names, and are “called” when needed. The necessary functions in an Arduino program are called setup() and loop(). These functions need to be declared, which means that you need to tell the Arduino what these functions will do. setup() and loop() are declared as you see on the right. In this program, you’re going to create a variable before you get into the main part of the program. Variables are names you give to places in the Arduino’s memory so you can keep track of what

is happening. These values can change depending on your pro­ gram’s instructions. Variable names should be descriptive of whatever value they are storing. For example, a variable named switchState tells you what it stores: the state of a switch. On the other hand, a vari­ able named “x” doesn’t tell you much about what it stores. To create a variable, you need to declare what type it is. The data type int will hold a whole number (also called an integer); that’s any number without a decimal point. When you declare a

variable, you usually give it an initial value as well. The declaration of the variable as every statement must end with a semicolon (;). The setup() runs once, when the Arduino is first powered on. This is where you configure the digital pins to be either inputs or outputs using a function named pinMode(). The pins connected to LEDs will be OUTPUTs and the switch pin will be an INPUT. The loop() runs continuously after the setup() has completed. The loop() is where you’ll check for voltage on the

inputs, and turn outputs on and off. To check the voltage level on a digital input, you use the function digitalRead() that checks the chosen pin for voltage. To know what pin to check, digitalRead() expects an argument. Arguments are information that you pass to functions, telling them how they should do their job. For example, digitalRead() needs one argument: what pin to check. In your program, digitalRead() is going to check the state of Create the loop function Configure pin functionality Let’s start coding

THE CODE Some notes before you start 36 Spaceship Interface Project 02 Case sensitivity Pay attention to the case sensitivity in your code. For example, pinMode is the name of a command, but pinmode will produce an error. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 void setup(){ } void loop(){ } int switchState = 0; void setup(){ pinMode(3,OUTPUT); pinMode(4,OUTPUT); pinMode(5,OUTPUT); pinMode(2,INPUT); } void loop(){ switchState = digitalRead(2); // this is a comment Comments If you ever want to include natural language in your program, you can leave

a comment. Comments are notes you leave for yourself that the computer ignores. To write a comment, add two slashes // The computer will ignore anything on the line after those slashes. { Curly brackets } Any code you write inside the curly brackets will be executed when the function is called. 37 pin 2 and store the value in the switchState variable. If there’s voltage on the pin when digitalRead() is called, the switchState variable will get the value HIGH (or 1). If there is no voltage on the pin, switchState will get the value LOW (or 0).

Above, you used the word if to check the state of something (namely, the switch position). An if() statement in programming compares two things, and determines whether the comparison is true or false. Then it performs actions you tell it to do. When comparing two things in programming, you use two equal signs ==. If you use only one sign, you will be setting a value instead of comparing it. digitalWrite() is the command that allows you to send 5V or 0V to an output pin. digitalWrite() takes two arguments:

what pin to control, and what value to set that pin, HIGH or LOW. If you want to turn the red LEDs on and the green LED off inside your if() statement, your code would look like this . You’ve told the Arduino what to do when the switch is open. Now define what happens when the switch is closed. The if() statement has an optional else component that allows for something to happen if the original condition is not met. In this case, since you checked to see if the switch was LOW, write code for the HIGH condition after the else statement.

To get the red LEDs to blink when the button is pressed, you’ll need to turn the lights off and on in the else statement you just wrote. To do this, change the code to look like this. After setting the LEDs to a certain state, you’ll want the Arduino to pause for a moment before changing them back. If you don’t wait, the lights will go back and forth so fast that it will appear as if they are just a little dim, not on and off. This is because the Arduino goes through its loop() thousands of times each

second, and the LED will be turned on and off quicker than we can perceive. The delay() function lets you stop the Arduino from executing anything for a period of time. delay() takes an argument that determines the number of milliseconds before it executes the next set of code. There are 1000 milliseconds in one second. delay(250) will pause for a quarter second. If you run your program now, the lights will change when you press the switch. That’s pretty neat, but you can add a little more complexity to the program for a

more interesting output. Now your program will flash the red LEDs when the switch button is pressed. 38 Spaceship Interface Project 02 Build up your spaceship The if statement if (switchState == LOW) { // the button is not pressed digitalWrite(3, HIGH); // green LED digitalWrite(4, LOW);  // red LED digitalWrite(5, LOW);  // red LED } else {  // the button is pressed digitalWrite(3, LOW); digitalWrite(4, LOW); digitalWrite(5, HIGH); delay(250);  // wait for a quarter second // toggle the LEDs digitalWrite(4, HIGH);

digitalWrite(5, LOW); delay(250); // wait for a quarter second } } // go back to the beginning of the loop 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 It can be helpful to write out the flow of your program in pseudocode: a way of describing what you want the program to do in plain language, but structured in a way that makes it easy to write a real program from it. In this case you’re going to determine if switchState is HIGH (meaning the button is pressed) or not. If the switch is pressed, you’ll turn the green LED off and the red ones on. In

pseudocode, the statement could look like this: if the switchState is LOW: turn the green LED on turn the red LEDs off if the switchState is HIGH: turn the green LED off turn the red LEDs on 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 39 In this project, you created your first Arduino program to control the behavior of some LEDs based on a switch. You’ve used variables, an if()...else statement, and functions to read the state of an input and control outputs. When you start creating an interface for your project, think about what people’s

expectations are while using it. When they press a button, will they want immedi­ ate feedback? Should there be a delay between their action and what the Arduino does? Try and place yourself in the shoes of a different user while you design, and see if your expectations match up to the reality of your project. 40 Spaceship Interface Project 02 How would you get the red LEDs to be blinking when your program starts? How could you make a larger, or more complex interface for your interstellar ad­ ventures with LEDs and switches?

Once your Arduino is programmed, you should see the green light turn on. When you press the switch, the red lights will start flashing, and the green light will turn off. Try changing the time of the two delay() functions; notice what happens to the lights and how the response of the system changes depending on the speed of the flashing. When you call a delay() in your program, it stops all other functionality. No sensor readings will happen until that time period has passed. While delays are often useful, when

designing your own projects make sure they are not unnecessarily interfering with your interface.

RESISTOR COLOR CODES Resistor values are marked using colored bands, according to a code developed in the 1920s, when it was too difficult to write numbers on such tiny objects. Each color corresponds to a number, like you see in the table below. Each resistor has either 4 or 5 bands. In the 4-band type, the first two bands indicate the first two digits of the value while the third one indicates the number of zeroes that follow (technically it reprents the power of ten). The last band specifies the tolerance: in the example below, gold indicates

that the resistor value can be 10k ohm plus or minus 5%. TEMPERATURE SENSOR 220 OHM RESISTOR LED INGREDIENTS 03 TURN THE ARDUINO INTO A LOVE MACHINE. USING AN ANALOG INPUT, YOU’RE GOING TO REGISTER JUST HOW HOT YOU REALLY ARE! While switches and buttons are great, there’s a lot more to the physical world than on and off. Even though the Arduino is a digital tool, it’s possible for it to get infor­ mation from analog sensors to measure things like temperature or light. To do this, you’ll take advantage of the Arduino’s built-in Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC).

Analog in pins A0-A5 can report back a value between 0-1023, which maps to a range from 0 volts to 5 volts. The Arduino IDE comes with a tool called the serial monitor that enables you to report back results from the microcontroller. Using the serial monitor, you can get information about the status of sensors, and get an idea about what is happening in your circuit and code as it runs. Time: 45 MINUTES Level: Builds on projects: 1, 2 Discover: analog Input, using the serial monitor LOVE-O-METER

You’ll be using a temperature sensor to measure how warm your skin is. This com­ ponent outputs a changing voltage depending on the temperature it senses. It has three pins: one that connects to ground, another that connects to power, and a third that outputs a variable voltage to your Arduino. In the sketch for this project, you’ll read the sensor’s output and use it to turn LEDs on and off, indicat­ ing how warm you are. There are several different models of temperature sensor. This model, the TMP36, is convenient because it outputs a voltage that changes

directly proportional to the temperature in degrees Celsius. Serial monitor Fig. 1 43 + - + - + - + - BUILD THE CIRCUIT Fig. 2 Fig. 3 In this project, you need to check the ambient temperature of the room before proceeding. You’re checking things manually right now, but this can also be accom­ plished through calibration. It’s possible to use a button to set the baseline tempera­ ture, or to have the Arduino take a sample before starting the loop() and use that as the reference point. Project 6 gets into details about this, or you can look at the

Calibration example that comes bundled with the Arduino software: arduino.cc/calibration 44 Love-o-Meter Project 03 Just as you’ve been doing in the earlier projects, wire up your breadboard so you have power and ground. Attach the cathode (short leg) of each of the LEDs you’re using to ground through a 220-ohm resistor. Connect the anodes of the LEDs to pins 2 through 4. These will be the indicators for the project. Place the TMP36 on the breadboard with the rounded part fac­ ing away from the Arduino (the order of the pins is important!)

as shown in Fig. 2. Connect the left pin of the flat facing side to power, and the right pin to ground. Connect the center pin to pin A0 on your Arduino. This is analog input pin 0. Create an interface for your sensor for people interact with. A paper cutout in the shape of a hand is a good indicator. If you’re feeling lucky, create a set of lips for someone to kiss, see how well that lights things up! You might also want to label the LEDs to give them some meaning. Maybe one LED means you’re a cold fish,

two LEDs means you’re warm and friendly, and three LEDs means you’re too hot to handle! ❶ ❷ ❸ ❶ Cut out a piece of paper that will fit over the breadboard. Draw a set of lips where the sensor will be, and cut some circles for the LEDs to pass through. ❷ Place the cutout over the breadboard so that the lips cover the sensor and the LEDs fit into the holes. Press the lips to see how hot you are! 45 Constants are similar to variables in that they allow you to uniquely name things in the program, but unlike variables they

cannot change. Name the analog input for easy reference, and create another named constant to hold the baseline temperature. For every 2 degrees above this baseline, an LED will turn on. You’ve already seen the int datatype, used here to identify which pin the sensor is on. The temperature is being stored as a float, or floating-point number. This type of number has a decimal point, and is used for numbers that can be expressed as fractions. In the setup you’re going to use a new command, Serial.

begin(). This opens up a connection between the Arduino and the computer, so you can see the values from the analog input on your computer screen. The argument 9600 is the speed at which the Arduino will communicate, 9600 bits per second. You will use the Arduino IDE’s serial monitor to view the information you choose to send from your microcontroller. When you open the IDE’s serial monitor verify that the baud rate is 9600. Next up is a for() loop to set some pins as outputs. These are the pins that you attached LEDs to earlier. Instead of giving them

unique names and typing out the pinMode() function for each one, you can use a for() loop to go through them all quickly. This is a handy trick if you have a large number of similar things you wish to iterate through in a program. Tell the for() loop to run through pins 2 to 4 sequentially. In the loop(), you’ll use a local variable named sensorVal to store the reading from your sensor. To get the value from the sensor, you call analogRead() that takes one argument: what pin it should take a voltage reading on. The value, which is

between 0 and 1023, is a representation of the voltage on the pin. The function Serial.print() sends information from the Arduino to a connected computer. You can see this information in your serial monitor. If you give Serial.print() an argument in quotation marks, it will print out the text you typed. If you give it a variable as an argument, it will print out the value of that variable.

arduino.cc/for 47 With a little math, it’s possible to figure out what the real voltage on the pin is. The voltage will be a value between 0 and 5 volts, and it will have a fractional part (for example, it might be 2.5 volts), so you’ll need to store it inside a float. Create a variable named voltage to hold this number. Divide sensorVal by 1024.0 and multiply by 5.0. The new number represents the voltage on the pin. Just like with the sensor value, you’ll print this out to the serial monitor. If you examine the sensor’s datasheet, there is information about

the range of the output voltage. Datasheets are like manuals for electronic components. They are written by engineers, for other engineers. The datasheet for this sensor explains that every 10 millivolts of change from the sensor is equivalent to a temperature change of 1 degree Celsius. It also indicates that the sensor can read temperatures below 0 degrees. Because of this, you’ll need to create an offset for values below freezing (0 degrees). If you take the voltage, subtract 0.5, and multiply by

100, you get the accurate temperature in degrees Celsius. Store this new number in a floating point variable called temperature. Now that you have the real temperature, print that out to the serial monitor too. Since the temperature variable is the last thing you’re going to be printing out in this loop, you’re going to use a slightly different command: Serial.println(). This command will create a new line in the serial monitor after it sends the value. This helps make things easier to read in when

they are being printed out. With the real temperature, you can set up an if()...else statement to light the LEDs. Using the baseline temperature as a starting point, you’ll turn on one LED on for every 2 degrees of temperature increase above that baseline. You’re going to be looking for a range of values as you move through the temperature scale. Convert the voltage to temperature and send the value to the computer Convert sensor reading to voltage Turn off LEDs for a low temperature 48 Love-o-Meter

You can check

for multiple conditions: “if the temperature is 2 degrees greater than the baseline, and it is less than 4 degrees above the baseline.” If the temperature is between two and four degrees above the baseline, this block of code turns on the LED on pin 3 as well. The Analog-to-Digital Converter can only read so fast, so you should put a small delay at the very end of your loop(). If you read from it too frequently, your values will appear erratic. With the code uploaded to the Arduino, click the serial monitor

icon. You should see a stream of values coming out, formatted like this : Sensor: 200, Volts: .70, degrees C: 17 Try putting your fingers around the sensor while it is plugged into the breadboard and see what happens to the values in the serial monitor. Make a note of what the temperature is when the sen­ sor is left in the open air. Close the serial monitor and change the baselineTemp constant in your program to the value you observed the temperature to be. Upload your code again, and try holding the sensor in your

fingers. As the temperature rises, you should see the LEDs turn on one by one. Congratulations, hot stuff!

Now it’s possible to read a large number of analog sensors and inputs. 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 Create an interface for two people to test their compatibility with each other. You get to decide what compatibility means, and how you’ll sense it. Perhaps they have

to hold hands and generate heat? Maybe they have to hug? What do you think? 51 PHOTORESISTOR GEL 220 OHM RESISTOR 10 KILOHM RESISTOR LED INGREDIENTS 04 USING A TRI-COLOR LED AND THREE PHOTORESISTORS, YOU’LL CREATE A LAMP THAT SMOOTHLY CHANGES COLORS DEPENDING ON EXTERNAL LIGHTING CONDITIONS Blinking LEDs can be fun, but what about fading them, or mixing colors? You might expect that it’s just a matter of providing less voltage to an LED to get it to fade. The Arduino can’t vary the output voltage on its pins, it can only output 5V. Hence

you’ll need to use a technique called Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) to fade LEDs. PWM rapidly turns the output pin high and low over a fixed period of time. The change happens faster than the human eye can see. It’s similar to the way movies work, quickly flashing a number of still images to create the illusion of motion. When you’re rapidly turning the pin HIGH and LOW, it’s as if you were changing the voltage. The percentage of time a pin is HIGH in a period is called duty cycle. When the pin is HIGH for

half of the period and LOW for the other half, the duty cycle is 50%. A lower duty cycle gives you a dimmer LED than a higher duty cycle. The Arduino Uno has six pins set aside for PWM (digital pins 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, and 11), they can be identified by the ~ next to their number on the board. Time: 45 MINUTES Level: Builds on projects: 1, 2, 3 Discover: analog output, mapping values COLOR MIXING LAMP For inputs in this project, you’ll be using photoresistors (sensors that change their resistance depending on the amount of light

that hits them, also known as photocells or light-dependent resis­ tors). If you connect one end of the resistor to your Arduino, you can measure the change in resistance by checking the voltage on the pin. 53 + - + - + - + - BUILD THE CIRCUIT Fig. 1 Fig. 3 Fig. 2 54 Color Mixing Lamp Project 04 Wire up your breadboard so you have power and ground on both sides, just like the earlier projects. Place the three photoresistors on the breadboard so they cross the center divide from one side to the other, as shown in Fig. 1.

Attach one end of each photoresistor to power. On the other side, attach a 10-kilohm resistor to ground. This resistor is in se­ ries with the photoresistor, and together they form a voltage di­ vider. The voltage at the point where they meet is proportional to the ratio of their resistances, according to Ohm’s Law (see Project  1 for more on Ohm’s Law). As the resistance of the pho­ toresistor changes when light hits it, the voltage at this junction changes as well. On the same side as the resistor, connect the

photoresistors to Analog In pins 0, 1, and 2 with hookup wire. Take the three colored gels and place one over each of the pho­ toresistors. Place the red gel over the photoresistor connected to A0, the green over the one connected to A1, and the blue over the one connected to A2. Each of these filters lets only light of a specific wavelength through to the sensor it’s covering. The red filter passes only red light, the green filter passes only green light, and the blue filter passes only blue light. This allows you to de­

tect the relative color levels in the light that hits your sensors. The LED with 4 legs is a common cathode RGB LED. The LED has separate red, green, and blue elements inside, and one common ground (the cathode). By creating a voltage difference between the cathode and the voltage coming out of the Arduino’s PWM pins (which are connected to the anodes through 220-ohm re­ sistors), you’ll cause the LED to fade between its three colors. Make note of what the longest pin is on the LED, place it in your

breadboard, and connect that pin to ground. Connect the other three pins to digital pins 9, 10 and 11 in series with 220-ohm resistors. Be sure to connect each LED lead to the correct PWM pin, according to the figure on the left. - R B G ❶ ❷ ❸ ❹ 55 Set up constants for the pins you’re using for input and output, so you can keep track of which sensor pairs with which color on the LED. Use const int for the datatype. Add variables for the incoming sensor values and for the output values you’ll be using to fade the LED. You can use the int

datatype for all the variables. In the setup(), begin serial communication at 9600 bps. Just like in the previous example, you will use this to see the values of the sensors in the serial monitor. Additionally, you will be able to see the mapped values you’ll use to fade the LED. Also, define the LED pins as outputs with pinMode(). In the loop() read the sensor values on A0, A1, and A2 with analogRead() and store the value in the appropriate variables. Put a small delay() between each analogRead() as the ADC

takes a millisecond to do its work. Print out the sensor values on one line. The “\t” is the equivalent of pressing the “tab” key on the keyboard.

It needs two arguments: the pin to write to, and a value between 0-255. This second number represents the duty cycle the Arduino will output on the specified pin. A value of

255 will set the pin HIGH all the time, making the attached LED as bright as it can be. A value of 127 will set the pin HIGH half the time of the period, making the LED dimmer. 0 would set the pin LOW all the time, turning the LED off. To convert the sensor reading from a value between 0-1023 to a value between 0-255 for analogWrite(), divide the sensor reading by 4. Print out the new mapped values on their own line. Once you have your Arduino programmed and wired up, open the serial monitor. The LED will probably be an off-white

color, depending on the predominant color of the light in your room. Look at the values coming from the sensors in the serial monitor, if you’re in an environment with stable lighting, the number should probably be fairly consistent. Turn off the light in the room you’re in and see what happens to the values of the sensors. With a flashlight, illuminate each of the sensors individually and notice how the values change in the serial monitor, and notice how the LED’s color changes. When the photoresistors are covered with a gel, they only re­

act to light of a certain wavelength. This will give you the op­ portunity to change each of the colors independently.

That’s okay for this project, but for a more detailed explanation of how to calibrate for the range you’re reading, see Project 6. How could you use this to let you know if it’s a nice day outside while you’re working inside? What other sorts of sensors can you use to control the LED’s color?

You’ll probably notice that the LED’s fading is not linear. When the LED is about at half brightness, it appears to stop getting much brighter. This is because our eyes don’t perceive brightness linearly. The brightness of the light depends not only on the level that you analogWrite() but also on the distance of the light from the diffuser, the distance of your eye from the light, and the brightness of the light rela­ tive to other light in the room. 59 No longer limited to just turning lights on and off, you

now have control over how bright or dim something will be. analogWrite() is the function that allows you to PWM components attached to pins 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, or 11, varying the duty cycle. The LED on its own is pretty neat, but it’s not much of a lamp. However, there are a number of different ways you can diffuse the light to make it resemble some­ thing like a traditional incandescent. A ping pong ball with a hole cut out for the LED to slide into makes for a nice diffuser. Other ways include covering the light

in translucent glue, or sanding the surface of the light. No matter what route you take, you’re going to lose at least a little brightness when it’s diffused, but it will probably look a lot nicer. The ping pong ball cut in order to accommodate the LED Fig.4 60 Color Mixing Lamp Project 04 POTENTIOMETER MOTOR ARM SERVO MOTOR 100UF CAPACITOR INGREDIENTS MALE HEADER PIN (3 pins) 05 USE A SERVO MOTOR TO MAKE A MECHANICAL GAUGE TO POINT OUT WHAT SORT OF MOOD YOU’RE IN THAT DAY Servo motors are a special type of motor that don’t spin around in a circle, but

move to a specific position and stay there until you tell them to move again. Servos usually only rotate 180 degrees (one half of a circle). Combining one of these motors with a little cardboard craft, you’ll be able to let people know if they should come and ask for your help on their next project or not. Similar to the way you used pulses to PWM an LED in the Color Mixing Lamp Project, servo motors expect a number of pulses that tell them what angle to move to. The pulses always come at the same time intervals, but the width varies between 1000

and 2000 microseconds. While it’s possible to write code to generate these pulses, the Arduino software comes with a library that allows you to easily control the motor. Because the servo only rotates 180 degrees, and your analog input goes from 0-1023, you’ll need to use a function called map() to change the scale of the values coming from the potentiometer. One of the great things about the Arduino community are the talented people who extend its functionality through additional software. It’s possible for anyone

to write libraries to extend the Arduino’s functionality. There are libraries for a wide variety of sensors and actuators and other devices that users have contributed to the community. A software library expands the functionality of a programming environment. The Arduino software comes with a number of libraries that are useful for working with hardware or data. One of the included libraries is designed to use with servo motors. In your code, you’ll import the library, and all of its functionality will be available to you.

Place a potentiometer on the breadboard, and connect one side to 5V, and the other to ground. A potentiometer is a type of volt­ age divider. As you turn the knob, you change the ratio of the voltage between the middle pin and power. You can read this

change on an analog input. Connect the middle pin to analog pin 0. This will control the position of your servo motor. The servo has three wires coming out of it. One is power (red), one is ground (black), and the third (white) is the control line that will receive information from the Arduino. Plug three male head­ ers into the female ends of the servo wires (see Fig. 3). Connect the headers to your breadboard so that each pin is in a different row. Connect 5V to the red wire, ground to the black wire, and

the white wire to pin 9. When a servo motor starts to move, it draws more current than if it were already in motion. This will cause a dip in the voltage on your board. By placing a 100uf capacitor across power and ground right next to the male headers as shown in Fig. 1, you can smooth out any voltage changes that may occur. You can also place a capacitor across the power and ground going into your potentiometer. These are called decoupling capacitors because they reduce, or decouple, changes caused by the components

from the rest of the circuit. Be very careful to make sure you are connecting the cathode to ground (that’s the side with a black stripe down the side) and the anode to power. If you put the capacitors in backwards, they can explode. Your servo motor comes with female connectors, so you’ll need to add header pins to connect it to the breadboard. Fig. 3 ❶ ❷ ❸ ❹ 65 To use the servo library, you’ll first need to import it. This makes the additions from the library available to your sketch. To refer to the servo, you’re going to need to create a named

instance of the servo library in a variable. This is called an object. When you do this, you’re making a unique name that will have all the functions and capabilities that the servo library offers. From this point on in the program, every time you refer to myServo, you’ll be talking to the servo object. Set up a named constant for the pin the potentiometer is attached to, and variables to hold the analog input value and angle you want the servo to move to. In the setup(), you’re going to need to tell the Arduino what

pin your servo is attached to. Include a serial connection so you can check the values from the potentiometer and see how they map to angles on the servo motor. In the loop(), read the analog input and print out the value to the serial monitor. To create a usable value for the servo motor from your analog input, it’s easiest to use the map() function. This handy function scales numbers for you. In this case it will change values between 0-1023 to values between 0-179. It takes five arguments : the

number to be scaled (here it’s potVal), the minimum value of the input (0), the maximum value of the input (1023), the minimum value of the output (0), and the maximum value of the output (179). Store this new value in the angle variable. Then, print out the mapped value to the serial monitor. Finally, it’s time to move the servo. The command servo. write() moves the motor to the angle you specify. At the end of the loop() put a delay so the servo has time to move to its new position. THE CODE Mapping potentiometer

You should see a stream of values similar to this: potVal : 1023, angle : 179 potVal : 1023, angle : 179 When you turn the potentiometer, you should see the num­ bers change. More importantly, you should see your servo

motor move to a new position. Notice the relationship be­ tween the value of potVal and angle in the serial monitor and the position of the servo. You should see consistent results as you turn the pot. One nice thing about using potentiometers as analog inputs is that they will give you a full range of values between 0 and 1023. This makes them helpful in testing projects that use analog input. USE IT Servo motors are regular motors with a number of gears and some circuits inside. The mechanics inside provide feedback to the circuit, so it is always aware of its posi­

tion. While it may seem like this is a limited range of motion, it’s possible to get it to make a wide variety of different kinds of movements with some additional mechanics. There are a number of resources that describe mechanisms in detail like robives.com/ mechs and the book Making Things Move by Dustyn Roberts. The potentiometer is not the only sensor you can use for controlling the servo. Using the same physical setup (an arrow pointing to a number of different indi­ cators) and a different sensor, what sort of indicator can you make? How would

this work with temperature (like in the Love-o-Meter)? Could you tell the time of day with a photoresistor? How does mapping values come into play with those types of sensors? Servo motors can easily be controlled by the Arduino using a library, which is a collection of code that extends a programming environment. Sometimes it is necessary to repurpose values by mapping them from one scale to another. 68 Mood Cue Project 05 Now that you’re up and running with motion, it’s time to let people know if you’re

available to help them on their projects, or if you want to be left alone to plan your next creation. With scissors, cut out a piece of cardboard in the shape of an arrow. Position your servo to 90 degrees (check the angle value in the serial monitor if you’re unsure). Tape the arrow so it’s oriented in the same direction as the motor’s body. Now you should be able to rotate the arrow 180 degrees when turning the potentiometer. Take a piece of paper that is larger than the servo with the arrow attached and

draw a half circle on it. On one end of the circle, write “Stay Out”. On the other end, write “Come in”. Put “Knock please!” in the middle of the arc. Place the servo with the arrow on top of the paper. Congratulations, you’ve got a way to tell people just how busy you are with your projects!

06 TIME TO MAKE SOME NOISE! USING A PHOTORESISTOR AND A PIEZO ELEMENT, YOU’RE GOING TO MAKE A LIGHT-BASED THEREMIN A theremin is an instrument that makes sounds based on the movements of a musician’s hands around the instrument. You’ve probably heard one in scary movies. The theremin detects where a performer’s hands are in relation to two antennas by reading the capacitive change on the antennas. These antennas are connected to analog circuitry that create the sound. One antenna controls the frequency of the sound and the other controls volume. While the Arduino can’t

exactly replicate the mysterious sounds from this instrument, it is possible to emulate them using the tone() function. Fig. 1 shows the difference between the pulses emitted by analogWrite() and tone(). This enables a transducer like a speaker or piezo to move back and forth at different speeds. Time: 45 MINUTES Level: Builds on projects: 1, 2, 3, 4 Discover: making sound with the tone() function, calibrating analog sensors LIGHT THEREMIN Fig. 1 10 MILLISECONDS Notice how the voltage is high most of the

TONE 880: tone(9,880) 0 5 PERIOD 71 + - + - + - + - Instead of sensing capacitance with the Arduino, you’ll be using a photoresistor

to detect the amount of light. By moving your hands over the sensor, you’ll change the amount of light that falls on the photoresistor’s face, as you did in Project 4. The change in the voltage on the analog pin will determine what frequency note to play. You’ll connect the photoresistors to the Arduino using a voltage divider circuit like you did in Project 4. You probably noticed in the earlier project that when you read this circuit using analogRead(), your readings didn’t range all the way from 0

to 1023. The fixed resistor connecting to ground limits the low end of the range, and the brightness of your light limits the high end. Instead of settling for a limited range, you’ll calibrate the sensor readings getting the high and low values, mapping them to sound frequencies using the map() function to get as much range out of your theremin as possible. This will have the added benefit of adjusting the sensor readings whenever you move your circuit to a new environment, like a room with different light conditions.

A piezo is a small element that vibrates when it receives electricity. When it moves, it displaces air around it, creating sound waves. BUILD THE CIRCUIT Fig. 2 72 Light Theremin Project 06 Fig. 3 On your breadboard, connect the outer bus lines to power and ground. Take your piezo, and connect one end to ground, and the other to digital pin 8 on the Arduino. Place your photoresistor on the breadboard, connecting one end to 5V. Connect the other end to the Arduino’s analogIn pin 0, and to ground through a 10-kilohm resistor. This circuit is the

same as the voltage divider circuit in Project  4. Traditional theremins can control the frequency and the volume of sound. In this example, You’ll be able to control the frequency only. While you can’t control the volume through the Arduino, it is possible to change the voltage level that gets to the speaker manually. What happens if you put a potentiometer in series with pin 8 and the piezo? What about another photoresistor? ❶ ❷ ❸ 73 Create a variable to hold the analogRead() value from the photoresistor. Next, create variables for the high and low values.

You’re going to set the initial value in the sensorLow variable to 1023, and set the value of the sensorHigh variable to 0. When you first run the program, you’ll compare these numbers to the sensor’s readings to find the real maximum and minimum values. Create a constant named ledPin. You’ll use this as an indicator that your sensor has finished calibrating. For this project, use the on-board LED connected to pin 13. In the setup(), change the pinMode() of ledPin to OUTPUT, and turn the light on.

The next steps will calibrate the sensor’s maximum and minimum values. You’ll use a while() statement to run a loop for 5 seconds. while() loops run until a certain condition is met. In this case you’re going to use the millis() function to check the current time. millis() reports how long the Arduino has been running since it was last powered on or reset. In the loop, you’ll read the value of the sensor; if the value is less than sensorLow (initially 1023), you’ll update that variable. If it is greater than sensorHigh (initially 0), that gets updated.

When 5 seconds have passed, the while() loop will end. Turn off the LED attached to pin 13. You’ll use the sensor high and low values just recorded to scale the frequency in the main part of your program.

Create a variable named pitch. The value of pitch is going

to be mapped from sensorValue. Use sensorLow and sensorHigh as the bounds for the incoming values. For starting values for output, try 50 to 4000. These numbers set the range of frequencies the Arduino will generate. Next, call the tone() function to play a sound. It takes three arguments : what pin to play the sound on (in this case pin 8), what frequency to play (determined by the pitch variable), and how long to play the note (try 20 milliseconds to start). Then, call a delay() for 10 milliseconds to give the sound some

time to play. When you first power the Arduino on, there is a 5 second win­ dow for you to calibrate the sensor. To do this, move your hand up and down over the photoresistor, changing the amount of light that reaches it. The closer you replicate the motions you expect to use while playing the instrument, the better the calibration will be. After 5 seconds, the calibration will be complete, and the LED on the Arduino will turn off. When this happens, you should hear some noise coming from the piezo! As the amount of

light that falls on the sensor changes, so should the frequency that the piezo plays. USE IT Read and store the sensor value Map the sensor value to a frequency Play the frequency 76 Light Theremin Project 06 void loop() { sensorValue = analogRead(A0); int pitch = map(sensorValue,sensorLow,sensorHigh, 50, 4000); tone(8,pitch,20); delay(10); } 19 20 21 22 23 24 The range in the map() function that determines the pitch is pretty wide, try changing the frequencies to find ones that are the right fit for your musical style.

The tone() function operates very much like the PWM in analogWrite() but with one significant difference. In analogWrite() the frequency is fixed; you change the ratio of the pulses in that period of time to vary the duty cycle. With tone() you’re still sending pulses, but changing the frequency of them. tone() always pulses at a 50% duty cycle (half the time the pin is high, the other half the time it is low). The tone() function gives you the ability to generate different frequencies when it pulses a speaker or piezo. When using

sensors in a voltage divider circuit, you probably won’t get a full range of values between 0-1023. By calibrating sensors, it’s possible to map your inputs to a useable range. 77 INGREDIENTS 10 KILOHM RESISTOR 1 MEGOHM RESISTOR 220 OHM RESISTOR SWITCH PIEZO 07 WITH FEW RESISTORS AND BUTTONS YOU ARE GOING TO BUILD A SMALL MUSICAL KEYBOARD While it’s possible to simply hook up a number of momentary switches to digital inputs to key of different tones, in this project, you’ll be constructing something

called a resistor ladder. This is a way to read a number of switches using the analog input. It’s a helpful technique if you find yourself short on digital inputs. You’ll hook up a number of switches that are connected in parallel to analog in 0. Most of these will connect to power through a resistor. When you press each button, a different voltage level will pass to the input pin. If you press two buttons at the same time, you’ll get a unique input based on the relationship between the two resistors in parallel.

Fig. 1 79 + - + - + - + - BUILD THE CIRCUIT The arrangement of resistors and switches feeding into an analog input is called a resistor ladder. Fig. 2 Fig. 3 80 Keyboard Instrument Project 07 Wire up your breadboard with power and ground as in the previous projects. Connect one end of the piezo to ground. Connect the other end to pin 8 on your Arduino.

Place your switches on the breadboard as shown in the circuit. The arrangement of resistors and switches feeding into an analog input is called a resistor ladder. Connect the first one directly to power. Connect the second, third and fourth switches to power through a 220-ohm, 10-kilohm and 1-megohm resistor, respectively. Connect all the switches’ outputs together in one junction. Connect this junction to ground with a 10-kilohm resistor, and also connect it to Analog In 0. Each of these acts as

a voltage divider. Think about an enclosure for the keyboard. While old analog synthesizers had wires poking out all over the place, your keyboard is sleek and digital. Prepare a small piece of cardboard that can be cut out to accommodate your buttons. Label the keys, so you know what notes are triggered by each key. ❶ ❷ ❶ Draw and cut a piece of paper with holes for the four buttons and piezo. Decorate it to look like a piano keyboard. ❷ Position the paper over the buttons and piezo. Enjoy your creation!

81 In this program, you’ll need to keep a list of frequencies you want to play when you press each of your buttons. You can start out with the frequencies for middle C, D, E and F (262Hz, 294Hz, 330Hz, and 349Hz). To do this, you’ll need a new kind of variable called an array. An array is a way to store different values that are related to each other, like the frequencies in a musical scale, using only one name. They are a convenient tool for you to quickly and efficiently access information. To declare an array, start as you

would with a variable, but follow the name with a pair of square brackets: []. After the equals sign, you’ll place your elements in curly brackets. To read or change the elements of the array, you reference the individual element using the array name and then the index of the item you want to address. The index refers to the order in which the items appear when the array is created. The first item in the array is item 0, the second is item 1, and so forth. Set up an array of four notes using the frequencies listed above.

Make this array a global variable by declaring it before the setup(). In your setup(), start serial communication with the computer. In the loop(), declare a local variable to hold the value read on pin A0. Because each switch has a different resistor value connecting it to power, each will have a different value associated with it. To see the values, add the line Serial. println(keyVal) to send to the computer. Using an if()...else statement, you can assign each value to a different tone. The values included in the example program are

ballpark figures for these resistor sizes. As all resistors have some tolerance for error, these may not work exactly for you. Use the information from the serial monitor to adjust as necessary. THE CODE The array Create an array of frequencies Begin serial communication Read the analog value and send it to the serial monitor Use an if()...else statement to determine what note to play 82 Keyboard Instrument Project 07 int buttons[6]; // set up an array with 6 integers int buttons[0] = 2; // give the first element of the array the value 2

int notes[] = {262,294,330,349}; void setup() { Serial.begin(9600); } void loop() { int keyVal = analogRead(A0); Serial.println(keyVal); if(keyVal == 1023){ tone(8, notes[0]); } 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 83 After each if() statement, call the tone() function. The program references the array to determine what frequency to play. If the value of A0 matches one of your if statements, you can tell the Arduino to play a tone. It’s possible your circuit is a little “noisy” and the values may fluctuate a little bit while

pressing a switch. To accommodate for this variation, it’s a good idea to have a small range of values to check against. If you use the comparison “&&”, you can check multiple statements to see if they are true. If you press the first button, notes[0] will play. If you press the second, notes[1] will play, and if you press the third, notes[2] will play. This is when arrays become really handy. Only one frequency can play on a pin at any given time, so if you’re pressing multiple keys, you’ll only hear one sound.

To stop playing notes when there is no button being pressed, call the noTone() function, providing the pin number to stop playing sound on. If your resistors are close in value to the values in the example program, you should hear some sounds from the piezo when you press the buttons. If not, check the serial monitor to make sure each of the buttons is in a range that corresponds to the notes in the if()...else statement. If you’re hearing a sound that seems to stutter, try increasing the range a little bit.

Press multiple buttons at the same time, and see what sort of values you get in the serial monitor. Use these new values to trigger even more sounds. Experiment with different frequencies to expand your musical output. You can find frequencies of musical notes on this page: arduino.cc/frequencies USE IT Play the notes that correspond to the analog value Stop playing the tone when nothing is pressed If you replace the switches and resistor ladder with analog sensors, can you use the additional information they give you to create a more dynamic instrument? You

could use the value to change the duration of a note or, like in the Theremin Project, create a sliding scale of sounds. 84 Keyboard Instrument Project 07 else if(keyVal >= 990 && keyVal <= 1010){ tone(8, notes[1]); } else if(keyVal >= 505 && keyVal <= 515){ tone(8, notes[2]); } else if(keyVal >= 5 && keyVal <= 10){ tone(8, notes[3]); } else{ noTone(8); } } The tone() function is fun for generating sounds, but it does have a few limi­ tations. It can only create square waves, not smooth sine waves or triangles.

Square waves don’t look much like waves at all. As you saw in Fig. 1 in Project 6, it’s a series of on and off pulses. As you start your band, keep some things in mind : only one tone can play at a time and tone() will interfere with analogWrite() on pins 3 and 11. Arrays are useful for grouping similar types of information together; they are accessed by index numbers which refer to individual elements. Resistor ladders are an easy way to get more digital inputs into a system by plugging into an

analog input. 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 85 INGREDIENTS 10 KILOHM RESISTOR 220 OHM RESISTOR SWITCH LED 08 IN THIS PROJECT, YOU’LL BUILD A DIGITAL HOURGLASS THAT TURNS ON AN LED EVERY TEN MINUTES. KNOW HOW LONG YOU’RE WORKING ON YOUR PROJECTS BY USING THE ARDUINO’S BUILT-IN TIMER Up to now, when you’ve wanted something to happen at a specific time interval with the Arduino, you’ve used delay(). This is handy, but a little confining. When the Arduino calls delay(), it freezes its current state for the duration of the delay. That

means there can be no other input or output while it’s waiting. Delays are also not very helpful for keeping track of time. If you wanted to do something every 10 seconds, having a 10 second delay would be fairly cumbersome. The millis() function helps to solve these problems. It keeps track of the time your Arduino has been running in milliseconds. You used it previously in Project 6 when you created a timer for calibration. So far you’ve been declaring variables as int. An int (integer) is a 16-bit number,

it holds values between -32,768 and 32,767. Those may be some large numbers, but if the Arduino is counting 1000 times a second with millis(), you’d run out of space in less than a minute. The long datatype holds a 32-bit number (between -2,147,483,648 and 2,147,483,647). Since you can’t run time backwards to get negative numbers, the variable to store millis() time is called an unsigned long. When a datatype is called unsigned, it is only positive. This allows you to count even higher. An unsigned long can count up to 4,294,967,295. That’s

enough space for milis() to store time for almost 50 days. By comparing the current millis() to a specific value, you can see if a certain amount of time has passed. When you turn your hourglass over, a tilt switch will change its state, and that will set off another cycle of LEDs turning on. The tilt switch works just like a regular switch in that it is an on/off sensor. You’ll use it here as a digital input. What makes tilt switches unique is that they detect orientation. Typically they have a small cavity inside the housing that has a metal

When tilted in the proper way, the ball rolls to one side of the cavity and connects the two leads that are in your breadboard, closing the switch. With six LEDs, your hourglass will run for an hour, just as its name implies. BUILD THE CIRCUIT Fig. 1 + - + - + - + - + - + - + - + - Fig. 2 88 Digital Hourglass Project 08 Connect power and ground to your breadboard. Connect the anode (longer leg) of six LEDs to digital pins 2-7.

Connect the LEDs to ground through 220-ohm resistors. Connect one lead of the tilt switch to 5V. Connect the other to a 10-kilohm resistor to ground. Connect the junction where they meet to digital pin 8. Tilt switches are great, inexpensive tools for determining the orientation of some­ thing. Accelerometers are another type of tilt sensor, but they give out much more information. They are also significantly more expensive. If you’re just looking to see if something is up or down, a tilt sensor works great.

You don’t need to have your Arduino tethered to the computer for this to work. Try building a stand with some cardboard or styrofoam and power the Arduino with a battery to make a portable version. You can create a cover with some nu­ meric indicators alongside the lights. ❶ ❷ ❸ 89 You’re going to need a number of global variables in your program to get this all working. To start, create a constant named switchPin. This will be the name of the pin your tilt switch is on. Create a variable of type unsigned long, This will hold the time

an LED was last changed. Create a variable for the switch state, and another to hold the previous switch state. You’ll use these two to compare the switch’s position from one loop to the next. Create a variable named led. This will be used to count which LED is the next one to be turned on. Start out with pin 2. The last variable you’re creating is going to be the interval between each LED turning on. This will be be a long datatype. In 10 minutes (the time between each LED turning on) 600,000 milliseconds pass. If you want the delay between lights to be

longer or shorter, this is the number you change. In your setup(), you need to declare the LED pins 2-7 as outputs. A for() loop declares all six as OUTPUT with just 3 lines of code. You also need to declare switchPin as an INPUT. When the loop() starts, you’re going to get the amount of time the Arduino has been running with millis() and store it in a local variable named currentTime. Using an if() statement, you’ll check to see if enough time has passed to turn on an LED. Subtract the currentTime from the

previousTime and check to see if it is greater than the interval variable. If 600,000 milliseconds have passed (10 minutes), you’ll set the variable previousTime to the value of currentTime. THE CODE Set the direction of your digital pins Check the time since the program started running Evaluate the amount of time that has passed since the previous loop() Declare a named constant Create a variable to hold the time Name variables for the inputs and outputs Declare a variable describing the interval between events

90 Digital Hourglass Project 08 1 2 3 4 const int switchPin = 8; unsigned long previousTime = 0; int switchState = 0; int prevSwitchState = 0; int led = 2; long interval = 600000; void setup() { for(int x = 2;x<8;x++){ pinMode(x, OUTPUT); } pinMode(switchPin, INPUT); } void loop(){ unsigned long currentTime = millis(); if(currentTime - previousTime > interval) { previousTime = currentTime; 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 5 13 14 15 16 91 previousTime indicates the last time an LED was turned on. Once you’ve set previousTime, turn on the LED, and increment

the led variable. The next time you pass the time interval, the next LED will light up. Add one more if statement in the program to check if the LED on pin 7 is turned on. Don’t do anything with this yet. You’ll decide what happens at the end of the hour later. Now that you’ve checked the time, you’ll want to see if the switch has changed its state. Read the switch value into the switchState variable. With an if() statement, check to see if the switch is in a different position than it was previously. The != evaluation checks to see

if switchState does not equal prevSwitchState. If they are different, turn the LEDs off, return the led variable to the first pin, and reset the timer for the LEDs by setting previousTime to currentTime. At the end of the loop(), save the switch state in prevSwitchState , so you can compare it to the value you get for switchState in the next loop(). Reset the variables to their defaults if necessary Once you’ve programmed the board, check the time on a clock. After 10 minutes have passed, the first LED should have

turned on. Every 10 minutes after that, a new light will turn on. At the end of an hour, all six light should be on. When you flip the circuit over, and cause the tilt switch to change its state, the lights will turn off and the timer will start again. USE IT Turn on an LED, prepare for the next one Check to see if all lights are on Read the value of the switch Set the current state to the previous state 92 Digital Hourglass Project 08 17 18 19 20 21 digitalWrite(led, HIGH); led++; if(led == 7){

} } switchState = digitalRead(switchPin); if(switchState != prevSwitchState){ for(int x = 2;x<8;x++){ digitalWrite(x, LOW); } led = 2; previousTime = currentTime; } prevSwitchState = switchState; } 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 22 30 31 When the clock reaches one hour and all six lights are on, they just stay on. Can you think of a way to get your attention when the hour is up? Sound or flashing the lights are both good indicators. The led variable can be checked to see if all the lights are on, that’s a good place to check for grabbing someone’s attention.

Unlike an hourglass filled with sand, the lights go either up or down depending on the orientation of the switch. Can you figure out how you can use the switch­ State variable to indicate what direction the lights should go? To measure the amount of time between events, use the millis() function. Because the numbers it generates are larger than what you can store in an int, you should use the datatype unsigned long for storing its values. 93 MOTOR SWITCH DIODE 1N4007 MOSFET 10 KILOHM RESISTOR BATTERY

9v batery INGREDIENTS 09 BATTERY SNAP MOTORIZED PINWHEEL GET THE ARDUINO TO SPIN A COLORFUL PINWHEEL USING A MOTOR Controlling motors with an Arduino is more complicated than just controlling LEDs for a couple of reasons. First, motors require more current than the Arduino’s out­ put pins can supply, and second, motors can generate their own current through a process called induction, which can damage your circuit if you don’t plan for it. However, motors make it possible to move physical things, making your projects

much more exciting. They’re worth the complications! Moving things takes a lot of energy. Motors typically require more current than the Arduino can provide. Some motors require a higher voltage as well. To start moving, and when it has a heavy load attached, a motor will draw as much cur­ rent as it can. The Arduino can only provide 40 milliamps (mA) from its digital pins, much less than what most motors require to work. Time: 45 MINUTES Level: Discover: transistors, high current/voltage loads Builds on projects: 1, 2, 3, 4

Transistors are components that allow you to control high current and high voltage power sources from the low current output of the Arduino. There are many differ­ ent kinds, but they work on the same principle. You can think of transistors as digital switches. When you provide voltage to one of the transistor’s pins, called the gate, it closes the circuit between the other two pins, called the source and drain. This way, you can turn a higher current/voltage motor on and off with your Arduino. Motors are a type of inductive device. Induction is a process by which a changing

electrical current in a wire can generate a changing magnetic field around the wire. When a motor is given electricity, a tightly wound coil inside the housing of copper creates a magnetic field. This field causes the shaft (the part that sticks out of the housing) to spin around. 95 BUILD THE CIRCUIT The reverse is also true: a motor can generate electricity when the shaft is spun around. Try attaching an LED to the two leads of your motor, then spin the shaft with your hand. If nothing happens, spin the shaft the other way. The LED should

light up. You’ve just made a tiny generator out of your motor. When you stop supplying energy to a motor, it will continue to spin, because it has inertia. When it’s spinning, it will generate a voltage in the opposite direction than the current you gave it. You saw this effect when you made your motor light up an LED. This reverse voltage, sometimes called back-voltage, can damage your transistor. For this reason, you should put a diode in parallel with the motor, so that the back voltage passes through the diode. The diode will only allow electric­

ity to flow in one direction, protecting the rest of the circuit. Fig. 2 Fig. 1 96 Motorized Pinwheel Project 09 Connect power and ground to your breadboard through the Arduino. Add a momentary switch to the board, connecting one side to power, and the other side to digital pin 2 on the Arduino. Add a 10-kilohm pull-down resistor to ground on the output pin of the switch. When using circuits with different voltages, you have to con­ nect their grounds together to provide a common ground. Plug the 9V battery snap into your breadboard. Connect ground from

the battery to ground of your Arduino on the breadboard with a jumper, as shown in Fig. 1. Then attach the motor’s free lead to the 9V power. Place the transistor on the board. Look at the component so that the metal tab is facing away from you. Connect digital pin 9 to the left pin on the transistor. This pin is called the gate. A change in voltage on the gate makes a connection between the other two pins. Connect one end of the motor to the middle pin of the transistor. This pin is called the drain. When the Arduino ac­

tivates the transistor by supplying voltage to the gate, this pin will be connected to the third pin, called the source. Connect the source to ground. Next, connect the motor’s voltage supply to the motor and breadboard. The last component to be added is the diode. The diode is a polarized component, it can go only one way in the circuit. Notice that the diode has a stripe on one end. That end is the negative end, or cathode, of the diode. The other end is the positive end, or anode. Connect the anode of the diode to the

ground of the motor and the cathode of the diode to the power of the motor. See Fig. 1. This may seem backwards, and in fact, it is. The diode will help prevent any back-voltage generated by the motor from going back into your circuit. Remember, back voltage will flow in the opposite direction of the voltage that you supply. LEDs are diodes too, in case you were wondering why their leads were also called anodes and cathodes. There are many kinds of diodes, but they all share one trait. They allow current to flow from anode to cathode, but not the reverse.

❶ ❷ ❸ ❹ ❺ 97 The code is remarkably similar to the code you first used for turning on an LED. First of all, set up some constants for the switch and motor pins and a variable named switchState to hold the value of the switch. In your setup(), declare the pinMode() of the motor (OUTPUT) and switch (INPUT) pins. Your loop() is straightforward. Check the state of the switch­ Pin with digitalRead(). If the switch is pressed, turn the motorPin HIGH. If it is not pressed, turn the pin LOW. When HIGH, the transistor will acti­

vate, completing the motor circuit. When LOW, the motor will not spin. Read the input, pull the output high if pressed Declare the pins’ direction Name your constants and variables THE CODE Motors have an optimal operating voltage. They will work on as little as 50% of the rated voltage and as much as 50% over that number. If you vary the voltage, you can change the speed at which the motor rotates. Don’t vary it too much, though, or you will burn out your motor. Motors require special consideration when being controlled by a microcontroller.

Typically the microcontroller cannot provide enough current and/or voltage to power a motor. Because of this, you use transistors to interface between the two. It’s also smart to use diodes to prevent damaging your circuit. 98 Motorized Pinwheel Project 09 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 const int switchPin = 2; const int motorPin = 9; int switchState = 0; void setup() { pinMode(motorPin, OUTPUT); pinMode(switchPin, INPUT); } void loop(){ switchState = digitalRead(switchPin); if (switchState == HIGH) { digitalWrite(motorPin, HIGH);

} else { digitalWrite(motorPin, LOW); } } Transistors are solid state devices, they have no moving parts. Because of this, you can switch them on and off very quickly. Try hooking up a potentiometer to an analog input and use that to PWM the pin that controls the transistor. What do you think will happen to the motor’s speed if you vary the voltage it’s getting? Using your patterns on your spinner, can you get different visual effects? 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 99 Assemble the CD hub as shown in step 1, and attach it to the

motor as shown in step 2. Attach the die-cut paper pattern to a CD as shown in step 3. Snap the CD to the hub and secure with a drop of glue. Allow to try before proceeding. Plug a 9V battery to your battery snap. Power your Arduino over USB. When you press the switch on the breadboard, the motor will spin very rapidly. USE IT ❶ Snap part C into part B, and then gently press part D on to them. ❸ Place the paper disk on the CD and secure it using the flaps on the back. 100 Motorized Pinwheel Project 09

With the motor spinning as fast as it does, you can probably make a pretty large spinner. Be careful that it doesn’t fly off and poke someone in the eye. Experiment with different patterns on the outside to create visual effects. ❷ Gently press the motor shaft into the hole in the back of part B. ❹ Attach the CD to the cross formed by parts B and D.

CREATE MOVING IMAGES IN FORWARD AND REVERSE WITH YOUR ARDUINO WHEN YOU CONNECT A MOTOR TO AN H-BRIDGE AND SOME STILL IMAGES Before the internet, television, even before movies, some of the first moving images were created with a tool called a zoetrope. Zoetropes create the illusion of motion from a group of still images that have small changes in them. They are typically cylinders with slits cut in the side. When the cylinder spins and you look through the slits, your eyes perceive the still images on the other side of the wall to be ani­

mated. The slits help keep the images from becoming a big blur, and the speed at which the images appear provide cause the images to appear to move. Originally, these novelties were spun by hand, or with a cranking mechanism. In this project, you’ll build your own zoetrope that animates a carnivorous plant. You’ll power the motion with a motor. To make this system even more advanced, you’ll add a switch that lets you control direction, another to turn it off and on, and a potentiometer to control the speed.

In the Motorized Pinwheel Project you got a motor to spin in one direction. If you were to take power and ground on the motor and flip their orientation, the motor would spin in the opposite direction. It’s not very practical to do that everytime you want to spin something in a different direction, so you’ll be using a compo­ nent called an H-bridge to reverse the polarity of the motor. H-bridges are a type of component known as integrated circuits (IC). ICs are components that hold large circuits in a tiny package. These can help simplify

more complex circuits by placing them in an easily replaceable component. For example, the H-bridge you’re using in this example has a number of transistors built in. To build the circuit inside the H-bridge you would probably need another breadboard. Time: 30 MINUTES Level: Builds on projects: 1, 2, 3, 4, 9 Discover: H-bridges ZOETROPE 103 With an IC, you can access the circuits through the pins that come out the sides. Different ICs have different numbers of pins, and not all of them are used in every circuit. It’s sometimes con­

venient to refer to the pins by number instead of function. When looking at an IC, the part with a dimple is referred to as the top . You can identify pin numbers by counting from the top-left in a “U” direction like in Fig. 1. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 16 15 14 13 12 11 10 9 BUILD THE CIRCUIT Fig. 2 Fig. 3 Fig. 1 + - + - + - + - 9V 104 Zoetrope Project 10 Connect power and ground from one side of your breadboard to the Arduino. Add 2 momentary switches to the breadboard, connecting one side of each to power. Add a 10Kohm pull-down resistor in

series with ground on the output pin of both switches. The switch on pin 4 will control direction, the switch on pin 5 will turn the motor on and off. Connect the potentiometer to the breadboard. Wire 5V to one side and ground to the other. Attach the center pin to analog input 0 on the Arduino. This will be used to control the speed of the motor. Place the H-bridge on your breadboard so it straddles the center (see Fig. 2 for detail of placement). Connect pin 1 of the H-bridge to digital pin 9 on the Arduino. This is the enable pin

on the H-bridge. When it receives 5V, it turns the motor on, when it receives 0V, it turns the motor off. You will use this pin to PWM the H-bridge, and adjust the speed of the motor. Connect pin 2 on the H-bridge to digital pin 3 on the Arduino. Connect pin 7 to digital pin 2. These are the pins you will use to communicate with the H-bridge, telling it which direction to spin. If pin 3 is LOW and pin 2 is HIGH, the motor will spin in one direction. If pin 2 is LOW and pin 3 is HIGH, the motor will spin

in the opposite direction. If both the pins are HIGH or LOW at the same time, the motor will stop spinning. The H-bridge get its power from pin 16, plug that into 5V. Pins 4 and 5 both go to ground. Attach your motor to pins 3 and 6 on the H-bridge. These two pins will switch on and off depending on the signals you send to pins 2 and 7. Plug the battery connector (without the battery attached!) to the other power rails on your breadboard. Connect ground from your Arduino to the battery’s ground. Connect pin 8 from

the H-bridge to the battery power. This is the pin that the H-bridge powers the motor from. Make sure you do not have your 9V and 5V power lines connected. They must be separate, only ground should be connected between the two. ❶ ❷ ❸ ❹ ❺ ❻ ❼ ❽ 105 Create constants for the output and input pins. Use variables to hold the values from your inputs. You’ll be doing state change detection for both switches, comparing the state from one loop to the next, similar to the Hourglass Project. So, in addition to storing the current state, you’ll need to record the

previous state of each switch. motorDirection keeps track of which direction the motor is spinning, and motorPower keeps track of whether the motor is spinning or not. In setup(), set the direction of each input and output pin. Turn the enable pin LOW to start, so the motor isn’t spinning right away. In your loop(), read the state of the On/Off switch and store it in the onOffSwitchState variable.

previous, and the switch is currently HIGH, set the motorPower variable to 1. If it is LOW, set the variable to 0. Read the values of the direction switch and potentiometer. Store the values in their respective variables. Check to see if the direction switch is currently in a different position than it was previously.If it is different, change the motor direction variable. There are only 2 ways for the motor to spin, so you’ll want to alternate the variable between two states. One way to accomplish this is by  using the inversion operator like so:

motorDirection =!motorDirection. The motorDirection variable determines which direction the motor is turning. To set the direction, you set the control pins setting one HIGH and the other LOW. When motorDirection changes, reverse the states of the control pins. If the direction switch gets pressed, you’ll want to spin the motor in the other direction by reversing the state of the controlPins. If the motorEnabled variable is 1, set the speed of the motor using analogWrite() to PWM the enable pin. If motorEnabled is

0, then turn the motor off by setting the analogWrite value to 0. Before exiting the loop(), save the current state of the switches as the previous state for the next run through the program.

When you press the On/Off switch, the motor should start spinning. If you turn the potentiometer, it should speed up and slow down. Pressing the On/Off button another time will stop the motor. Try pressing the direction button and verify the motor spins both ways. Also, if you turn the knob on the pot, you should see the motor speed up or slow down depending on the

value it is sending. Once you’ve verified that the circuit works as expected, disconnect the battery and USB from the circuit. ❶ Secure the CD onto the wooden base. Add a drop of glue to make sure it doesn’t spin loose when the motor starts. ❷ Use the tabs to close the cutout, forming a circle. 110 Zoetrope Project 10 In order to build your zoetrope, you must take the pinwheel you used in Project 9 and the cutout with the vertical slits that is included in your kit. Once the CD is se­ curely attached to the shaft of the motor, plug everything back in. Hold your project

up, so you can look through the slits (but make sure the CD is secured to the motor, and don’t get too close to it). You should see the sequence of still images “move”! If it is going too fast or too slow, turn the knob of the potentiometer to adjust the speed of the animation. Try pressing the direction switch to see what the animation looks like when played backwards. The zoetrope and images provided in the kit are only your starting point: try experimenting with your own animations, using the cutout as a reference.

To do this, start with a basic image. Identify one fixed point in it, and make small changes to the rest in each frame. Try to gradually return to the original image so that you can play the animation in a continuous loop. ❶ Insert the four tabs into the base of the zoetrope. ❶ Insert the strip of paper with the images inside the zoetrope. 111 Zoetropes work because of a phenomena called “persistence of vision”, sometimes abbreviated to POV. POV describes the illusion of motion that is created when our

eyes observe still images with minor variations in rapid succession. If you search online for “POV display”, you’ll find many projects made by people that leverage this effect, often with LEDs and an Arduino. Make a base to support the motor. A small cardboard box with a hole cut in it could work as a base, leaving your hands free to play with the switches and knob. This will make it easier to show off your work to everyone. With a little work, you can get your zoetrope working in low light situations as well.

Hook up an LED and resistor to one of your free digital output pins. Also add a sec­ ond potentiometer, and connect it to an analog input. Position the light so it shines on the images. Using the analog input to time the flashes of the LED, try and time it so the light flashes when the slit is in front of your eyes. This could take some fiddling with the knobs, but the resulting effect is really spectacular! 112 Zoetrope Project 10 INGREDIENTS 11 10 KILOHM RESISTOR 220 OHM RESISTOR SWITCH POTENTIOMETER

LCD SCREEN CREATE A CRYSTAL BALL TO TELL YOUR FUTURE Crystal balls can help “predict” the future. You ask a question to the all-knowing ball, and turn it over to reveal an answer. The answers will be predetermined, but you can write in anything you like. You’ll use your Arduino to choose from a total of 8 responses. The tilt switch in your kit will help replicate the motion of shaking the ball for answers. The LCD can be used to display alphanumeric characters. The one in your kit has 16 columns and 2 rows, for a total of 32 characters. There are a large number of

connections on the board. These pins are used for power and communication, so it knows what to write on screen, but you won’t need to connect all of them. See Fig. 1 for the pins you need to connect.

+ - + - + - + - Fig. 2 Fig. 3 In this schematic the LCD pins arrangement does not match the physical order depicted in Fig. 2. In a schematic, the pins are rearranged by logical grouping to make the schematic as clear as pos­ sible. This is a little confusing to newcomers until you get used to it. 116 Crystal Ball Project 11 The circuit is not overly complex, but there are a lot of wires. Pay attention when wiring everything up to make sure it’s correct. Connect power and ground to one side of your breadboard.

Place the tilt switch on the breadboard and attach one lead to 5V. Attach the other side to ground through a 10-kilohm resis­ tor, and to your Arduino’s pin 6. You’re wiring this as a digital input, just as you’ve done in several other projects. The register select (RS) pin controls where the characters will appear on screen. The read/write pin (R/W) puts the screen in read or write mode. You’ll be using the write mode in this project. The enable (EN) tells the LCD that it will be receiving a command. The data pins (D0-D7) are used to send charac­

ter data to the screen. You’ll only be using 4 of these (D4-D7). Finally, there’s a connection for adjusting the contrast of the display. You’ll use a potentiometer to control this. The LiquidCrystal library that comes with the Arduino software handles all the writing to these pins, and simplifies the process of writing software to display characters. The two outside pins of the LCD (Vss and LED-) need to be connected to ground. Also, connect the R/W pin to ground. This places the screen in write mode. The LCD power supply (Vcc)

should connect directly to 5V. The LED+ pin on the screen con­ nects to power through a 220-ohm resistor. Connect: Arduino Digital pin 2 to LCD D7, Arduino Digital pin 3 to LCD D6, Arduino Digital pin 4 to LCD D5, Arduino Digital pin 5 to LCD D4. These are the data pins that tell the screen what character to display. Connect EN on the screen to pin 11 on your Arduino. RS on the LCD connects to pin 12. This pin enables writing to the LCD. Place the potentiometer on the breadboard, connecting one end pin to power and the other to ground. The center pin

should connect to V0 on the LCD. This will allow you to change the contrast of the screen. ❶ ❷ ❸ ❹ ❺ ❻ ❼ 117 First, you’ll need to import the LiquidCrystal library. Next, you’ll initialize the library, somewhat similar to the way you did with the Servo library, telling it what pins it will be using to communicate. Now that you’ve set up the library, it’s time to create some variables and constants. Create a constant to hold the pin of the switch pin, a variable for the current state of the switch, a

variable for the previous state of the switch, and one more to choose which reply the screen will show. Set up the switch pin as an input with pinMode() in your setup(). Start the LCD library, and tell it how large the screen is. Now it’s time to write a small introductory screen welcoming you to the 8-ball. The print() function writes to the LCD screen. You’re going to write the words “Ask the” on the top line of the screen. The cursor is automatically at the beginning of the top line. In order to write to the next line, you’ll have to tell the screen

where to move the cursor. The coordinates of the first column on the second line are 0,1 (recall that computers are zero indexed. 0,0 is the first column of the first row). Use the function lcd. setCursor() to move the cursor to the proper place, and tell it to write “Crystal ball!”. Now, when you start the program, it will say “Ask the Crystal ball!” on your screen. In the loop(), you’re going to check the switch first, and put the value in the switchState variable. Use an if() statement to determine if the switch is in a different

position than it was previously. If it is different than it was before, and it is currently LOW, then it’s time to choose a random reply. The random() function returns a number based on the argument you provide it. To start, you’ll have a total number of 8 different responses for the ball. Whenever the statement random(8) is called, it will give a number between 0-7. Store that number in your reply variable. Set up the LiquidCrystal library Print your first line Move the cursor Choose a random anwser

This also moves the cursor back to location 0,0; the first column in the first row of the LCD. Print out the line “ The ball says:” and move the cursor for the output. The switch() statement executes different pieces of code depending on the value you give it. Each of these different pieces of code is called a case. switch() checks the value of the variable reply; whatever value reply holds will determine what

named case statement is executed. Inside the case statements, the code will be the same, but the messages will be different. For example, in case 0 the code says lcd.print (“Yes”). After the lcd.print() function, there’s another command: break. It tells the Arduino where the end of the case is. When it hits break, it skips to the end of the switch statement. You’ll be creating a total of 8 case statements to start out. Four of the responses will be positive, 2 will be negative, and the final 2 will ask you to try again.

The last thing to do in your loop() is to assign switchState’s value to the variable prevSwitchState. This enables you to track changes in the switch the next time the loop runs. Predict the future 120 Crystal Ball Project 11 19 20 21 22 lcd.clear(); lcd.setCursor(0, 0); lcd.print(“The ball says:”); lcd.setCursor(0, 1); switch(reply){ case 0: lcd.print(“Yes”); break; case 1: lcd.print(“Most likely”); break; case 2: lcd.print(“Certainly”); break; case 3: lcd.print(“Outlook good”); break; case 4: lcd.print(“Unsure”);

Check the screen to make sure it says “Ask the Crystal ball!” If you can’t see the char­ acters, try turning the potentiometer. It will adjust the contrast of the screen.

Ask a question of your crystal ball, and try tilting the switch up­ side down and back again. You should get an answer to your question. If the answer doesn’t suit you, ask again. LCDs work by changing the electrical properties of a liquid sandwiched between polarized glass. The glass only allows certain kinds of light to pass through. When the liquid between the glass is charged, it starts to form into a semi-solid state. This new state runs in a different direction than the polarized glass, blocking light from

passing through, thus creating the characters you see on the screen. Try adding your own sayings to the print() statements, but be mindful of the fact that there are only 16 characters to use per line. You can also try adding more responses. Make sure when you add additional switch cases, you adjust the number of options that will randomly populate the reply variable. The functions covered here for changing the LCD screen’s text are fairly simple. Once you have a handle on how it works, look at some of the other functions the

library has. Try getting text to scroll, or continually update. To find out more about how the LiquidCrystal library works, visit: arduino.cc/lcd An LCD display enables you to show text on a screen, using the LiquidCrystal library.

MAKE YOUR OWN SECRET LOCKING MECHANISM TO KEEP UNWANTED GUESTS OUT OF YOUR SPACE! The piezo you used for playing back sounds in the theremin and keyboard pro­ jects can also be used as an input device. When plugged into 5V, the sensor can detect vibrations that can be read by the Arduino’s analog inputs. You’ll need to plug in a high value resistor (like 1-megohm) as the reference to ground for this to work well. When the piezo is pressed flat against a solid surface that can vibrate, like a wood­

en table top, your Arduino can sense how intense a knock is. Using this informa­ tion you can check to see if a number of knocks fall in an acceptable range. In code you can track the number of knocks and see if they match your settings. A switch will let you lock the motor in place. Some LEDs will give you status: a red LED will indicate the box is locked, a green LED will indicate the box is unlocked, and a yellow LED lets you know if a valid knock has been received. You’ll also be writing your own function that will let you know if a knock is too loud

or too soft. Writing your own function helps save time programming by reusing code instead of writing it out many times. Functions can take arguments and return values. In this case, you’ll give a function the volume of the knock. If it is in the right range, you’ll increment a variable. It’s possible to build the circuit by itself, but it’s much more fun if you use this as a tool to lock something. If you have a wooden or a cardboard box you can cut holes into, use the servo motor to open and close a latch, keeping people from

getting at your stuff.

Connect power and ground to both sides of the breadboard. Place the pushbutton on the breadboard and connect one end to 5V. On the other side of the switch, connect to ground through a 10-kilohm resistor. Connect this junction to digital

pin 2 on the Arduino. Attach the wires from the piezo to the breadboard. Attach one wire to power. If your piezo has a red wire or one marked with a “+”, that is the one to connect to power. If your piezo doesn’t indicate polarity, then you can hook it up either way. Wire the other end of the piezo to Analog Pin 0 on your Arduino. Place a 1-megohm resistor between the ground and the other wire. Lower resistor values will make the piezo less sensitive to vibrations. Wire up the LEDs, connecting the cathodes (short leg) to

ground, and placing a 220-ohm resistor in series with the an­ odes. Through their respective resistors, connect the yellow LED to Arduino digital pin 3, the green LED to digital pin 4, and the red LED to digital pin 5. Insert the male headers into the female socket on the servo motor (see Fig.3). Connect the red wire to power, and the black wire to ground. Place a 100uF electrolytic capacitor across power and ground to smooth out any irregularities in voltage, making sure you have the capacitor’s polarity correct. Connect

the servo’s data wire to pin 9 on your Arduino. ❶ ❷ ❸ ❹ Your servo motor comes with female connectors, so you’ll need to add header pins to connect it to the breadboard. Fig. 3 127 Just as in the earlier Mood Cue Project, you’ll need to import the Servo library and create an instance to use the motor. Create constants to name your inputs and outputs. Create variables to hold the values from your switch and piezo. Set up some constants to use as thresholds for the knock maximum and minimum levels.

The locked variable will let you know if the lock is enganged or not. A boolean is a data type that can only be true (1) or false (0). You should start with the mechanism unlocked. The last global variable will hold the number of valid knocks you have received. In your setup(), attach the servo to pin 9. Set the LED pins as outputs and the switch pins as inputs. Initialize serial communication with the computer so you can monitor the knock volume, what the current state of the lock is, and how many more knocks you have to go.

Turn on the green LED, move the servo to the unlocked position, and print the current status to the serial monitor indicating the circuit is in the unlocked position. In the loop(), you’ll first check to see if the box is locked or not. This will determine what happens in the rest of the program. If it is locked, read the switch value.

Turn the green LED off, and the red LED on. If you don’t have the serial monitor on, this is helpful visual feedback to let you know the status of

the lock. Move the servo into the lock position, and print out a message to the serial monitor indicating the box is now locked. Add a delay so the lock has plenty of time to move into place. If the locked variable is true, and the lock is engaged, read the value of the vibration of the piezo and store it in knockVal. The next statement checks to see if you have fewer than three valid knocks, and there is some vibration on the sensor. If these are both true, check to see if this current knock is valid or not and

increment the numberOfKnocks variable. This is where you’ll call your custom function checkForKnocks(). You’ll write the function once you’re finished with the loop(), but you already know you’re going to be asking it if this is a valid knock, so pass the knockVal along as an argument. After checking your function, print out the number of knock still needed. Check to see if you have three or more valid knocks. If this is true, change the locked variable to false, and move the servo to the unlocked position. Wait for a few milliseconds to let it start

moving, and change the status of the green and red LEDs. Print out a status message to the serial monitor, indicating the box is unlocked. Close up the else statement and the loop() with a pair of curly brackets. Now it’s time to write the function checkForKnock(). When you’re writing functions of your own, you need to indicate if it is going to return a value or not. If it is not going to return a value, you declare it as type void, similar to the loop() and setup() functions. If it is going to return a value, you must declare what kind (int, long,

float, etc.). In this case, you’re checking to see if a knock is valid (true) or not (false). Declare the function as type boolean.

knockVal) to see if it is valid or not. To pass this variable along to the function, you create a named parameter when you declare the function. In your function, whenever you refer to value it will use whatever number it receives as an argument in the main program. At this point value will be set to whatever knockVal is. Check to see if value is greater than your quiet knock, and less than your loud knock. If the value falls between those two values it’s a valid knock. Blink the yellow LED once and print the value of the knock to the serial

monitor. To let the main program know what the outcome of the comparison is, you use the command return. You use the return command, which also terminates the function: once it executes, you return to the main program. If value is either too quiet or too loud, print it out to the serial monitor and return false. Close up your function with one more bracket . When you first plug in the circuit to your Arduino, open the serial monitor. You should see the green LED turn on, and the servo will move to the unlocked position.

The serial monitor should print out “The box is unlocked!”. You’ll probably hear the piezo make a small “click” when it first gets power. Try knocking soft and hard to see what sort of intensity knock triggers your function.

It will also let you know the number of knocks you have to go before unlocking the box. Once you’ve reached the right number of knocks, the red light will turn off, the green light will turn on, the servo will move

90 degrees, and the serial monitor will let you know the lock is disengaged. 133 The values for your ideal knock may vary from the ones in the example. This de­ pends on a number of different variables, like the type of surface the sensor is attached to and how sturdily it is fixed on there. Using the serial monitor and the AnalogInSerialOut example in the Arduino IDE, find an appropriate knock value for your setup. You can find a detailed explanation of that example here: arduino.cc/analogtoserial

If you move the project into a box, you’ll need to make holes for the LEDs and the switch. You’ll also need to make a latch for the servo motor to spin into. It will probably also be helpful to have a hole to run your USB cable through to find out how sensitive your new environment is to knocks. You may need to rearrange your breadboard and Arduino, or solder the LEDs and switch to make them accessible to the exterior of your enclosure. Soldering is a process of joining two or more metal components together with an adhesive that

is melted between the joint. If you’ve never soldered before, ask someone who has experience to help you out, or try practicing on some scrap wire before attempting with another device in this project. When you solder something, it’s meant to be a permanent connection, so be sure it’s something that’s ok to hack. See arduino.cc/soldering for a good explanation of how to solder. ❶ Cut 2 holes in your box: one on the side, and a second through the cover flap. Place the servo in the box so that the arm can move in and out of the holes when closed.

134 Knock Lock Project 12 Writing your own functions not only allows you to control the flow of your code more easily, it also helps keep it readable as your projects become larger and larger. Over time, as you write more code, you may find you have a large number of functions you can re-use in different projects, making the process quicker and unique to your style of programming. Piezo elements can be used as inputs when wired up as voltage dividers with a high value resistor. Designing a function is an easy way to write code that can be reused

for specific tasks. This example simply counts the right number of knocks, no matter how long it takes. You can start to make a more complex example by creating a timer with millis(). Use the timer to identify if the knocks happen in a specific period of time. Look back at the Digital Hourglass Project for an example of how a timer works. You aren’t lim­ ited to simply finding knocks in a specific range. You can look for complex patterns of knocks based on the amount of vibration and timing together. There are a number

of examples online that talk about how to do this, search for “Arduino knock lock” to discover more examples of this type of project. ❷ Secure the servo in place with some tape, again making sure the arm can easily rotate through the slot you made. 135 1 MEGOHM RESISTOR METAL FOIL 220 OHM RESISTOR LED INGREDIENTS 13 YOU WILL CREATE A LAMP THAT TURNS A LIGHT ON AND OFF WHEN YOU TOUCH A PIECE OF CONDUCTIVE MATERIAL You’ll be using the CapacitiveSensor library by Paul Badger for this project. This library allows you to measure the capacitance of your body.

Capacitance is a measure of how much electrical charge something can store. The library checks two pins on your Arduino (one is a sender, the other a receiver), and measures the time it takes for them to have the same state. These pins will be connected to a metal object like aluminum foil. As you get closer to the object, your body will absorb some of the charge, causing it to take longer for the two pins to be the same. The most recent version of the CapacitiveSensor library is here: arduino.cc/capacitive. Download the file to your computer

and unzip it. Open your Arduino sketch folder (it will be in your “Documents” folder by default). In the folder, create a new di­ rectory named “libraries”. Place the CapacitiveSensor folder you unzipped in this folder and restart the Arduino software. Click the File>Examples menu in the Arduino software, and you’ll see a new entry for “CapacitiveSensor”. The library you added included an example project. Open the CapacitiveSensorSketch example and compile it. If you don’t get any errors, you’ll know

you installed it correctly. For more information on libraries: arduino.cc/en/Reference/Libraries Time: 45 MINUTES Level: Builds on projects: 1, 2, 5 Discover: installing third party libraries, creating a touch sensor TOUCHY-FEELY LAMP Preparing the library 137 BUILD THE CIRCUIT Fig. 1 Fig. 2 138 Touchy-feely Lamp Project 13 Connect an LED to pin 12, and connect the cathode to ground through a 220-ohm resistor as shown. Connect digital pins 2 and 4 to your breadboard. Connect the two pins with a 1-megahom resistor. In the same row as pin 2,

insert a long wire (8-10cm at least) that extends away from the breadboard, not connected to anything on the other end. This will become your touch sensor. Just like with other LED projects, diffusing the light will make this much more at­ tractive. Ping pong balls, little lampshades from paper or plastic, whatever you have handy will work. You can hide the sensor behind something solid and it will still work. Capacitance can be measured through non-conductive materials like wood and plastic. Increas­

ing the surface area of the sensor with a larger conductive surface will make it more sensitve; try connecting aluminum foil, or copper mesh to your wire. You could make a base for the lamp out of cardboard, thin wood, or cloth, and line the inner surface with foil attached to your sensor wire. The whole base of the lamp would then act as a touch sensor. Update the threshold variable in the code when you make these changes to ensure that you’re still getting a reliable result. There’s no need to supply 5V to your

breadboard in this project. Digital pin 4 supplies the current to the sensor. ❶ ❷ 139 At the beginning of your program, include the CapacitiveSensor library. You include it the same way you would a native Arduino library like the Servo library in the earlier projects. Create a named instance of the library. When you use this library, you tell the instance what pins it will be using to send and receive information. In this case, pin 4 sends to the conductive sensor material through the resistor, and pin 2 is the sense pin.

Set up a variable for the sensing threshold at which the lamp will turn on. You’ll change this number after you test the sensor’s functionality. Then define the pin your LED will be on. In the setup() function, open a Serial connection at 9600 bps. You’ll use this to see the values the sensor reads. Also, make your ledPin an OUTPUT. In the loop() function, create a variable of type long to hold the sensor’s value. The library returns the sensor value using a com­ mand called CapacitiveSensor() that takes an argument

identifying the number of samples you want to read. If you read only a few samples, it’s possible you’ll see a lot of variation in the sensor. If you take too many samples, you could introduce a lag as it reads the sensor multiple times. 30 samples is a good start­ ing value. Print the sensor value to the serial monitor. With an if()...else statement, check to see if the sensor value is higher than the threshold. If it is, turn the LED on. If it is not, turn it off. Then add a small delay() before ending the loop().

} delay(10); } 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 141 Third party libraries like Paul Badger’s CapacitiveSensor are useful tools for expanding the capabilities of the Arduino. Once installed, they behave similarly to libraries that are bundled with the core software. After programming the Arduino, you’ll want to find out what the sensor values are when it’s touched. Open the serial moni­ tor and note the value coming from the sensor when you’re not touching it. Press gently on the bare wire you have exposed from

your breadboard. The number should increase. Try pressing more firmly and see if it changes. Once you have an idea of the range of values you’re getting from the sensor, go back to the sketch and change the threshold vari­ able to a number that is greater than the sensor’s value when it is not touched, but less than its value when pressed. Upload the sketch with the new value. The light should come on reliably when you touch the wire, and turn off when it’s left alone. If you aren’t getting the light to turn on, try lowering the threshold a

little more. USE IT You probably noticed that the values from the sensor changed depending on how much of your finger was touching the conductor. Can you use this to get other interactions with the LED? What about multiple sensors for fading the light brighter and darker? If you place a different value resistor between pins 2 and 4 it will change the sensitivity. Is this useful for your interface? 142 Touchy-feely Lamp Project 13 INGREDIENTS 14 POTENTIOMETER USING SERIAL COMMUNICATION, YOU’LL USE YOUR

ARDUINO TO CONTROL A PROGRAM ON YOUR COMPUTER You’ve done a lot of cool stuff with the physical world, now it’s time to control your computer with your Arduino. When you program your Arduino, you’re opening a connection between the computer and the microcontroller. You can use this connection to send data back and forth to other applications. The Arduino has a chip that converts the computer’s USB-based communication to the serial communication the Arduino uses. Serial communication means that the two computers, your Arduino and PC, are exchanging bits of information

serially, or one after another in time. When communicating serially, computers need to agree on the speed at which they talk to one another. You’ve probably noticed when using the serial monitor there’s a number at the bottom right corner of the window. That number, 9600 bits per second, or baud, is the same as the value you’ve declared using Serial. begin(). That’s the speed at which the Arduino and computer exchange data. A bit is the smallest amount of information a computer can understand. You’ve used the serial monitor to look at values from the analog inputs; you’ll

use a similar method to get values into a program you’re going to write in a programming environment called Processing. Processing is based on Java, and Arduino’s programming environment is based on Processing’s. They look pretty similar, so you should feel right at home there. Before getting started with the project, download the latest version of Processing from processing.org. It may be helpful to look at the “Getting started” and “Overview” tutorials at processing.org/learning. These will help you to familiarize

yourself with Processing before you start writing software to communicate with your Arduino. Time: 45 MINUTES Level: Builds on projects: 1, 2, 3 Discover: serial communication with a computer program, Processing TWEAK THE ARDUINO LOGO 145 The most efficient way to send data between the Arduino and Processing is by using the Serial.write() function in Arduino. It’s similar to the Serial. print() function you’ve been using in that it sends information to an attached computer, but instead of sending human readable information like numbers and

letters, it sends values between 0-255 as raw bytes. This limits the values that the Arduino can send, but allows for quick transmission of information. On both your computer and Arduino, there’s something called the serial buffer which holds onto information until it is read by a program. You’ll be sending bytes from the Arduino to Processing’s serial buffer. Processing will then read the bytes out of the buffer. As the program reads information from the buffer, it clears space for more. When using serial communication between devices and programs, it’s important

that both sides not only know how fast they will be communicating, but also what they should be expecting. When you meet someone, you probably expect a “Hello!”; if instead they say something like “The cat is fuzzy”, chances are you will be caught off guard. With software, you will need to get both sides to agree on what is sent and received. Fig. 1 146 Tweak the Arduino Logo Project 14 Fig. 2 Fig. 3 BUILD THE CIRCUIT Connect power and ground to your breadboard. Connect each end of your potentiometer to power and ground.

Connect the middle leg to analogIn pin 0. ❶ ❷ 147 First, program your Arduino. In setup(), you’ll start serial communication, just as you did earlier when looking at the values from an attached sensor. The Processing program you write will have the same serial baud rate as your Arduino. In the loop(), you’re going to use the Serial.write() command to send information over the serial connection. Serial.write() can only send a value between 0 and 255. To make sure you’re sending values that fit within that range, divide

the analog reading by 4. After sending the byte, wait for one millisecond to let the ADC settle down. Upload the program to the Arduino then set it aside while you write your Processing sketch. THE ARDUINO CODE THE PROCESSING CODE The Processing language is similar to Arduino, but there are enough differences that you should look at some of their tutorials and the “Getting Started” guide mentioned before to familiarize yourself with the language. Open a new Processing sketch. Processing, unlike the Arduino,

doesn’t know about serial ports without including an external library. Import the serial library. You need to create an instance of the serial object, just like you’ve done in Arduino with the Servo library. You’ll use this uniquely named object whenever you want to use the serial connection. To use images in Processing, you need to create an object that will hold the image and give it a name. Open a serial connection Send the sensor value Let the ADC stabilize Import the set up the serial object

Create an object for the image 148 Tweak the Arduino Logo Project 14 1 2 3 void setup() { Serial.begin(9600); } void loop() { Serial.write(analogRead(A0)/4); delay(1); } 4 5 6 7 1 2 import processing.serial.*; Serial myPort; PImage logo; SAVE AND CLOSE THE ARDUINO IDE NOW, LET’S START PROCESSING. 3 149 Create a variable that will hold the background hue of the Arduino logo. The logo is a .png file, and it has built-in transparency, so it’s possible to see the background color change. Processing has a setup() function, just like Arduino. Here’s

where you’ll open the serial connection and give the program a couple of parameters that will be used while it runs. You can change the way Processing works with color information. Typically, it works with colors in a Red Green Blue (RGB) fashion. This is similar to the color mixing you did in Project  4, when you used values between 0 and 255 to change the color of an RGB LED. In this program, you’re going to use a color mode called HSB, which stands for Hue, Saturation, and Brightness. You’ll change the hue when you turn the potentiometer.

colorMode() takes two arguments: the type of mode, and the maximum value it can expect. To load the Arduino image into the sketch, read it into the logo object you created earlier. When you supply the URL of an image, Processing will download it when you run the program. With the size() function, you tell Processing how large the display window will be. If you use logo.width and logo. height as the arguments, the sketch will automatically scale to the size of the image you’re using. Processing has the ability to print out status messages using the

println() command. If you use this in conjunction with the Serial.list() function, you’ll get a list of all the serial ports your computer has when the program first starts. You’ll use this once you’re finished programming to see what port your Arduino is on. You need to tell Processing information about the serial connection. To populate your named serial object myPort with the necessary information, the program needs to know it is a new instance of the serial object. The parameters it expects are

which application it will be speaking to, which serial port it will communicate over, and at what speed. Variable to store the background color Setting the color mode Loading the image Printing available serial ports Creating the serial object 150 Tweak the Arduino Logo Project 14 4 int bgcolor = 0; void setup() { colorMode(HSB, 255); logo = loadImage(“http://arduino.cc/logo.png”); size(logo.width, logo.height); println(“Available serial ports:”); println(Serial.list()); myPort = new Serial(this, Serial.list()[0], 9600);

} 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 151 The attribute this tells Processing you’re going to use the serial connection in this specific application. The Serial.list() [0] argument specifies which serial port you’re using. Serial. list() contains an array of all the attached serial devices. The argument 9600 should look familiar, it defines the speed at which the program will communicate. The draw() function is analogous to Arduino’s loop() in that it happens over and over again forever. This is where things are

drawn to the program’s window. Check if there is information from the Arduino. The myPort. available() command will tell you if there is something in the serial buffer. If there are bytes there, read the value into the bgcolor variable and print it to the debug window. The function background() sets the color of the window. It takes three arguments. The first argument is the hue, the next is brightness, and the last is saturation. Use the variable bgcolor as the hue value, and set the brightness and saturation to the

maximum value, 255. You’ll draw the logo with the command image(). You need to tell image() what to draw, and what coordinates to start drawing it in the window. 0,0 is the top left, so start there. USE IT Connect your Arduino and open the serial monitor. Turn the pot on your breadboard. You should see a number of charac­ ters as you twist the knob. The serial monitor expects ASCII characters, not raw bytes. ASCII is information encoded to represent text in computers. What you see in the window is

the serial monitor trying to interpret the bytes as ASCII. When you use Serial.println(), you send information formatted for the serial monitor. When you use Serial. write(), like in this application you are running now, you’re sending raw information. Programs like Processing can understand these raw bytes. Reading Arduino data from the serial port Setting the image background and displaying the image 152 Tweak the Arduino Logo Project 14 void draw() { if (myPort.available() > 0) { bgcolor = myPort.read();

println(bgcolor); } background(bgcolor, 255, 255); image(logo, 0, 0); } 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 153 Close the serial monitor. Run the Processing sketch by press­ ing the arrow button in the Processing IDE. Look at the Pro­ cessing output window. You should see a list similar to the figure below. This is a list of all the serial ports on your computer. If you’re using OSX, look for a string that says something like “/dev/ tty.usbmodem411”, it will most likely be the first element in the list. On Linux, it may appear as “/dev/ttyUSB0”, or simi­

lar. For Windows, it will appear as a COM port, the same one you would use when programming the board. The number in front of it is the Serial.list()[] array index. Change the number in your Processing sketch to match the correct port on your computer. Restart the Processing sketch. When the program starts run­ ning, turn the potentiometer attached to the Arduino. You should see the color behind the Arduino logo change as you turn the potentiometer. You should also see values printing out in the Processing window. Those numbers correspond to

the raw bytes you are sending from the Arduino. 154 Tweak the Arduino Logo Project 14 Once you have twisted and turned to your heart’s desire, try replacing the pot with an analog sensor. Find something you find interesting to control the color. What does the interaction feel like? It’s probably different than using a mouse or keyboard, does it feel natural to you? When using serial communication, only one application can talk to the Arduino at a time. So if you’re running a Processing sketch that is connected to your Arduino, you

won’t be able to upload a new Arduino sketch or use the serial monitor until you’ve closed the active application. With Processing and other programming environments, you can control media on your computer in some remarkable and novel ways. If you’re excited about the pos­ sibilities of controlling content on your computer, take some time to experiment with Processing. There are several serial communication examples in both the Pro­ cessing and Arduino IDEs that will help you explore further. Serial communication enables the Arduino to talk with

programs on a computer. Processing is an open source programming environment that the Arduino IDE is based upon. It’s possible to control a Processing sketch with the Arduino via serial communication. 155 INGREDIENTS 15 220 OHM RESISTOR OPTOCOUPLER GET CONTROL OF OTHER COMPONENTS AROUND YOU. USING SOME ADDITIONAL CIRCUITRY, YOU CAN “PRESS” BUTTONS WITH YOUR ARDUINO Warning: You’re no longer a beginner if you’re doing this project. You’ll be opening up an electronic device and modifying it. You’ll void your device’s warranty, and if

you’re not careful, you might damage the device. Make sure you’re familiar with all the electronics concepts in the earlier projects before you attempt this one. We recommend you use inexpensive items you don’t mind damaging for your first few projects, until you develop experience and confidence. While the Arduino can control a lot of things, sometimes it’s easier to use tools that are created for specific purposes. Perhaps you want to control a television or a music player, or drive a remote control car. Most electronic devices have a

control panel with buttons, and many of those buttons can be hacked so that you can “press” them with an Arduino. Controlling recorded sound is a good example. If you wanted to record and play back recorded sound, it would take a lot of effort to get the Arduino to do that. It’s much easier to get a small device that records and plays back sound, and replace its buttons with outputs controlled by your Arduino. Optocouplers are integrated circuits that allow you to control one circuit from a different one without any electrical connection between the two. Inside an

optocoupler is an LED and a light detector. When the LED in the optocoupler is turned on by your Arduino, the light detector closes a switch internally. The switch is connected to two of the output pins (4 and 5) of the optocoupler. When the internal switch is closed, the two output pins are connected. When the switch is open, they’re not connected. This way, it’s possible to close switches on other devices without connecting them to your Arduino. Time: 45 MINUTES Level: Builds on projects: 1, 2, 9

Discover: optocoupler, connecting with other components HACKING BUTTONS 157 BUILD THE CIRCUIT Fig. 1 Fig. 2 In this example, the diagrams are for controlling a digital recording module that allows you to record and playback 20 seconds of sound, but the basic premise holds for any device that has a switch you can access. While it’s possible to use this example without soldering any wires, it certainly makes things easier. For more information on soldering, see p. 134. 158 Hacking Buttons Project 15

Connect ground to your breadboard through the Arduino. Place the optocoupler on your breadboard so that it straddles the center of the board (see circuit diagram). Connect pin 1 on the optocoupler to Arduino pin 2 in series with a 220-ohm resistor (remember, you’re powering an LED inside, you don’t want to burn it out). Connect pin 2 of the optocou­ pler to ground. On the main board of the sound module there are a number of electrical components, including a playback button. To control the switch, you’re going to have to remove the but­

ton. Flip the circuit board over and find the tabs that hold the button in place. Gently bend the tabs back and remove the but­ ton from the board. Under the button are two small metal plates. This pattern is typical of many electronic devices with pushbuttons. The two “forks” of this pattern are the two sides of the switch. A small metal disc inside the pushbutton connects these two forks when you press the button. When the forks are connected, the switch is closed on the circuit board. You will be closing the switch with the optocoupler.

This method, closing a switch with an optocoupler, works only if one of the two sides of the pushbutton’s switch is connected to ground on your device. If you’re not sure, take a multimeter and measure the voltage between one of the forks and the ground on your device. You need to do this with the device turned on, so be careful not to touch anywhere else on the board. Once you know which fork is ground, disconnect the power to your device. Next, connect one wire to each of the small metal plates. If you

are soldering these wires, be careful to not join the two sides of the switch together. If you are not soldering and using tape, make sure your connection is secure, or the switch won’t close. Make sure neither wire connects to the other fork, or your switch will be closed all the time. Attach the two wires to pins 4 and 5 of the optocoupler. Connect the side of the switch that is grounded to pin 4 of the optocou­ pler. Connect the other fork to pin 5 of the optocoupler. ❶ ❷ ❸ ❹ ❺ ❻ ❼ ❽ 159 Most of the fun with this project is in the circuit and the

optocoupler. The code is similar to the first project you made with the Arduino. You’re going to play the sound once every 20 seconds by turning pin 2 HIGH. Create a constant for the optocoupler control pin. In setup(), set the optocoupler pin into an output. The loop() turns optoPin HIGH for a few milliseconds, long enough for the optocoupler to close the switch on the device. Then the optoPin becomes LOW. Wait for 21 seconds for the whole message to play back before starting the loop() again. THE CODE

Attach the battery to the sound recorder. Press and hold the record button on the device. While you’re holding the button, you can record audio into the microphone. Use your voice, the cat, or the pots and pans in the kitchen to make some noise (but be careful with the cat). Once you’ve satisfactorily recorded a sound, power your Ar­ duino with the USB cable. Your recording should start to play. If you recorded for the full 20 seconds, the sound should start again just a few moments after it ends.

USE IT Try experimenting with different sounds and durations of toggling the playback with the delay() in your program. If you trigger the switch while a sound is playing, it will stop. How can you take advantage of this to create unique sequences of sounds? Name a constant Configure the pin direction Pull the pin high and low Wait for a little while 160 Hacking Buttons Project 15 1 const int optoPin = 2; void setup(){ pinMode(optoPin, OUTPUT); } void loop(){ digitalWrite(optoPin, HIGH); delay(15);

digitalWrite(optoPin, LOW); delay(21000); } 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Integrated circuits are in virtually every electronic device. The large 28 pin chip on your Arduino is an IC that houses the brains of the board. There are other ICs that support this one with communication and power. The optocoupler and main chip on the Arduino are Dual In-line Package (DIP) chips. These DIP chips are the kind that most hobbyists use because they easily fit in a breadboard and don’t have to be per­ manently soldered to be used.

The project example only played sound back at a regular interval. How could you incorporate the inputs from earlier projects to trigger these sounds? What other battery powered things do you have around the house that need an Arduino to con­ trol them? This technique of controlling an electronic device with an optocoupler by connecting to the two sides of a switch can be used in many other devices. What other devices do you want to control? Optocouplers can control devices that are on a different

circuit.

WE’VE COLLECTED THEM ALL HERE FOR REFERENCE 163 A Accelerometer - A sensor that measures ac­ celeration. Sometimes, they are used to detect orientation, or tilt. Actuator - A type of component that changes electrical energy into motion. Motors are a type

of actuator. Alternating current - A type of current where electricity changes its direction periodically. This is the sort of electricity that comes out of a wall socket. Amperage (amps or amperes) - The amount of electrical charge flowing past a specific point in your circuit. Describes the current as it flows through a conductor, like a wire. Analog - Something that can continuously vary over time. Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) - A circuit that converts an analog voltage into a digital number representing that voltage. This circuit

is built-in to the microcontroller, and is con­ nected to the analog input pins A0-A5. Con­ verting an analog voltage into a digital number takes a tiny bit of time, so we always follow the analogRead() with a short delay(). Anode - The positive end of a capacitor or diode (remember that an LED is a type of diode). Argument - A type of data supplied to a func­ tion as an input. For example, for digitalRead() to know what pin to check, it takes an argu­ ment in the form of a pin number. Array - In programming, this is a group of vari­

ables that are identified by one name, and ac­ cessed by an index number. B Back-voltage - Voltage that pushes back against the current that created it. It can be created by motors spinning down. This can damage circuits, which is why diodes are often used in conjunction with motors. Baud - Shorthand for “bits per second”, signify­ ing the speed at which computers are commu­ nicating with each other. Binary - A system with only two states, like true/false or off/on. Bit - The smallest piece of information a com­

puter can send or receive. It has two states, 0 and 1. Boolean - A datatype that indicates if some­ thing is true or false. Byte - 8 bits of information. A byte can hold a number between 0 and 255. C Calibration - The process of making adjustments to certain numbers or components to get the best results from a circuit or program. In Arduino projects, this is often used when sensors in the real world may give different values in different circumstances, for instance the amount of light on a photoresistor. Calibration can be automatic,

as in Project  6, or manual, as in Project  3. Capacitance - The ability of something to hold an electrical charge. This charge can be measured with the Capacitive Sensor library, as seen in Project  13. Cathode - The end of a capacitor or diode that typically connects to ground. Circuit - A circular path from a power supply, through a load, and then back again to the other end of the power supply. Current flows in a circuit only if it is closed, that is, if the out­ going and return path are both uninterrupted,

or closed. If either path is interrupted, or open, then current will not flow through the circuit. Common cathode LED - Types of LEDs that have multiple colors in one fixture, with one cathode and multiple anodes. Conductor - Something that enables electricity to flow, like a wire. Constant - A named identifier that cannot change its value in a program. Current - The flow of electrical charge through a closed circuit. Measured in amps. D Datasheet - A document written by engineers for other engineers that describes the design

and functionality of electrical components. Typical information in a datasheet includes the maximum voltage and current a component requires, as well as an explanation of the func­ tionality of the pins. Datatype - A classification system that deter­ mines what values a particular constant, varia­ ble, or array will hold. Int, float, long and boolean are all types that can be used in Arduino. Debugging - The process of going through a cir­ cuit or code, and finding errors (also referred as “bugs”), until the expected behavior is achieved.

164 Glossary Decoupling capacitors - Capacitors that are used to regulate spikes and dips in voltage, of­ ten placed close to a sensor or actuator. Digital - A system of discrete values. As Arduino is a type of digital device, it only knows of two discrete states, off and on, nothing in between. Direct current - A type of current which always flows in the same direction. All the projects in this kit use direct current. Drain (transistor) - The pin that connects to the higher current/voltage load to be controlled.

Dual In-line Package (DIP) - A type of packaging for integrated circuits that allows the compo­ nents to be easily inserted into a breadboard. Duty cycle - A ratio indicating the amount of time over a certain period that a component is turned on. When using a PWM value of 127 (out of a total of 256), you’re creating a 50% duty cycle. E Electricity - A type of energy generated by electric charges. You can use electronic com­ ponents to change electricity to other forms of energy, like light and heat.

F Float - A datatype that can be expressed as a fraction. This entails the use of decimal points for floating point numbers. Function - A block of code that executes a spe­ cific task repeatedly. G Gate - The pin on a transistor that is connected to the Arduino. When the gate is turned on, by applying 5V, it closes the junction between drain and source, completing the circuit it is connected to.

Other programming environments, like Processing, have their own IDE. Index - The number supplied to an array that indicates which element you’re referring to.

Computers are zero-indexed, which means they start counting at 0 instead of 1. To access the third element in an array named tones, for example, you would write tones[2].

from flowing. Conductive materials like wires are often covered in insulators like rubber. Int - A datatype that holds a whole number be­ tween −32,768 and 32,767. Integrated Circuit (IC) - A circuit that has been created on a tiny piece of silicon and embedded in plastic (or epoxy). Pins, or legs, protruding from the body allow you to interact with the circuit inside. Very often we can make good use of an IC knowing only what to connect to the pins without having to understand how it func­ tions internally.

Phototransistor - A transistor which is con­ trolled by light rather than by current. Polarized - The leads of polarized components

(e.g. LEDs or capacitors) have different func­ tions, and thus must be connected the right way. Polarized components connected the wrong way might not work, might be damaged, or might damage other parts of your circuit. Non-polarized components (e.g. resistors) can be connected either way. Power supply - A source of energy, usually a bat­ tery, transformer, or even the USB port of your computer. Comes in many varieties such as regulated or unregulated, AC or DC. Usually the voltage is specified, along with the maximum

current the supply can deliver before failing. Processing - A programming environment based on the Java language. Used as a tool to introduce people to the concepts of program­ ming, and in production environments. The Arduino IDE is written in Processing, and so will look very familiar. In addition, Processing and Arduino share a similar philosophy and mo­ tive, of creating free open source tools allowing non-technical people to work with hardware and software. Pseudocode - A bridge between writing in a

computer programming language and using natural speech. When creating pseudocode, it’s helpful to write in short declarative statements.

R Resistance - A measure of how efficiently a material will conduct electricity. In particular, resistance can be calculated by Ohm’s Law as:

R = V/I. S Sensor - A component that measures one form of energy (like light or heat or mechanical en­ ergy) and converts it to electrical energy, which the Arduino can understand. Serial buffer - A place in your computer’s and microcontroller’s memory where information received in serial communication is stored until it is read by a program. Serial communication - The means by which the Arduino communicates with computers and other devices. It involves sending one bit of information at a time in a sequential order. The

Serial monitor - A tool built in to the Arduino IDE allowing sending and receiving serial data to and from a connected Arduino. See the 167 Serial() set of functions. Series - Components are in series when current flows from the first into the next. The current flowing through both is the same, and the volt­ age drops across each component. Short circuit - A short circuit between power

and ground will make your circuit stop work­ ing and thus should be avoided. In some cases this might damage your power supply or parts of your circuit, and rare cases might start a fire. Sketch - The term given to programs written in the Arduino IDE. Soldering - The process of making an electri­ cal connection by melting solder over electrical components or wires that are to be connected. This provides a solid connection between com­ ponents.

power, the source and drain are connected, completing the circuit that is being controlled. Square wave - A type of waveform that is iden­ tified by having only two states, on and off. When used to generate tones, they can sound “buzzy”. Switch - A component that can open or close an electrical circuit. There are many different kinds of switches; the ones in the kit are momentary mean­ ing, they only close the circuit while being pressed. T Transducer - Something that changes one form of energy into another.

Transistor - A 3 terminal (usually) electronic device which can act as either an amplifier or a switch. A control voltage or current between two leads controls a (usually) higher voltage or current between a different pair of leads. Com­ mon types of transistors include the Bipolar Junction Transistor (BJT) and the Metal Oxide Semiconductor Field Effect Transistor (MOS­ FET). Often used to allow a small current from an Arduino (limited to 40 mA) to control sub­ stantially larger currents, such as those needed

by motors, relays, or incandescent lamps. De­ pending on how they are constructed, transis­ tors are either N-channel or P-channel, which determines how they should be connected. U Unsigned - A term used to describe some data­ types, indicating that they cannot be a negative number. It’s helpful to have an unsigned num­ ber if you only need to count in one direction. For instance, when keeping track of time with millis(), it’s advisable to use the unsigned long datatype. USB - Stands for Universal Serial Bus. It’s a ge­

neric port that is standard on most computers today. With a USB cable, it’s possible to program and power an Arduino over a USB connection. V Variable -  A place in your computer’s or mi­ crocontroller’s memory for storing informa­ tion needed in a program. Variables store values which are likely to change as your pro­ gram runs. A variable’s type depends on the type of information you want to store, and the maximum size of the information; for example, a byte can store up to 256 differ­ 168 Glossary

ent values, but an int can store up t 65,536 different values. Variables can be local to a particular block of code, or global to an entire program. (see Global variable, Local variable). Voltage - A measure of potential energy, that a charge might be pushed with if provided a closed circuit. Voltage divider - A type of circuit that provides an output that is a fraction of its input voltage. You are building a voltage divider when you combine a photoresistor with a fixed resistor to provide an analog input. A potentiometer is

another example of a voltage divider. 169 Getting Started with Arduino by Massimo Banzi [O’Reilly Media / Make, 2011]. The definitive introduction to Arduino.

BASIC ELECTRONIC COMPONENTS MODEL ECK-10 Instruction Manual by Arthur F. Seymour MSEE It is the intention of this course to teach the fundamental operation of basic electronic components by comparison to drawings of equivalent mechanical parts. It must be understood that the mechanical circuits would operate much slower than their electronic counterparts and one-to-one correlation can never be achieved. The comparisons will, however, give an insight to each of the fundamental electronic components used in every electronic product.

The electronic component known as the resistor is best described as electrical friction. Pretend, for a moment, that electricity travels through hollow pipes

like water. Assume two pipes are filled with water and one pipe has very rough walls. It would be easy to say that it is more difficult to push the water through the rough-walled pipe than through a pipe with smooth walls. The pipe with rough walls could be described as having more resistance to movement than the smooth one. Pioneers in the field of electronics thought electricity was some type of invisible fluid that could flow through certain materials easily, but had difficulty flowing through other materials. In a way they were

correct since the movement of electrons through a material cannot be seen by the human eye, even with the best microscopes made. There is a similarity between the movement of electrons in wires and the movement of water in the pipes. For example, if the pressure on one end of a water pipe is increased, the amount of water that will pass through the pipe will also increase. The pressure on the other end of the pipe will be indirectly related to the resistance the pipe has to the flow of water. In

other words, the pressure at the other end of the pipe will decrease if the resistance of the pipe increases. Figure 1 shows this relationship graphically. Electrons flow through materials when a pressure (called voltage in electronics) is placed on one end of the material forcing the electrons to “react” with each other until the ones on the other end of the material move out. Some materials hold on to their electrons more than others making it more difficult for the electrons to move. These materials have a

higher resistance to the flow of electricity (called current in electronics) than the ones that allow electrons to move easily. Therefore, early experimenters called the materials insulators if they had very high resistance to electon flow and conductors if they had very little resistance to electron flow. Later materials that offered a medium amount of resistance were classified as semiconductors. When a person designs a circuit in electronics, it is often necessary to limit the amount of electrons or

current that will move through that circuit each second. This is similar to the way a faucet limits the amount of water that will enter a glass each second. It would be very difficult to fill a glass without breaking it if the faucet had only two states, wide open or off. By using the proper value of resistance in an electronic circuit designers can limit the pressure placed on a device and thus prevent it from being damaged or destroyed. SUMMARY: The resistor is an electronic component that has electrical friction. This friction

opposes the flow of electrons and thus reduces the voltage (pressure) placed on other electronic components by restricting the amount of current that can pass through it. Figure 1 Low Resistance Pipe High Resistance Pipe (rough walls) Low Pressure High Pressure Through Same Size Opening Water Tank -2- RESISTORS RESISTORS, How are they made? There are many different types of resistors used in electronics. Each type is made from different materials. Resistors are also made to handle different amounts of electrical power. Some

resistors may change their value when voltages are placed across them. These are called voltage dependent resistors or nonlinear resistors. Most resistors are designed to change their value when the temperature of the resistor changes. Some resistors are also made with a control attached that allows the user to mechanically change the resistance. These are called variable resistors or potentiometers. Figure 2 shows physical shapes of some different types of resistors. The first commercial resistors made were formed by

wrapping a resistive wire around a non-conducting rod (see Figure 3). The rod was usually made of some form of ceramic that had the desired heat properties since the wires could become quite hot during use. End caps with leads attached were then placed over the ends of the rod making contact to the resistive wire, usually a nickel chromium alloy. The value of wirewound resistors remain fairly flat with increasing temperature, but change greatly with frequency. It is also difficult to precisely control the

value of the resistor during construction so they must be measured and sorted after they are built. By grinding carbon into a fine powder and mixing it with resin, a material can be made with different resistive values. Conductive leads are placed on each end of a cylinder of this material and the unit is then heated or cured in an oven. The body of the resistor is then painted with an insulating paint to prevent it from shorting if touched by another component. The finished resistors are then measured and sorted by value (Figure 4). If these

resistors are overloaded by a circuit, their resistance will permanently decrease. It is important that the power rating of the carbon composition resistor is not exceeded. Figure 2 Carbon Film Variable Carbon Composition THE WIREWOUND RESISTOR Figure 3 THE CARBON COMPOSITION RESISTOR Ceramic Rod Wire End Cap Protective Coating Figure 4 Insulating Paint Carbon & Resin Mixture Conductive Wire -3- RESISTORS CARBON FILM RESISTORS Carbon film resistors are made by depositing a very thin layer of carbon on a ceramic rod. The resistor is

then protected by a flameproof jacket since this type of resistor will burn if overloaded sufficiently. Carbon film resistors produce less electrical noise than carbon composition and their values are constant at high frequencies. You can substitute a carbon film resistor for most carbon composition resistors if the power ratings are carefully observed. The construction of carbon film resistors require temperatures in excess of 1,000OC. Metal oxide resistors are also constructed in a similar manner as the carbon film resistor with the

exception that the film is made of tin chloride at temperatures as high as 5,000OC. Metal oxide resistors are covered with epoxy or some similar plastic coating. These resistors are more costly than other types and therefore are only used when circuit constraints make them necessary. Metal film resistors are also made by depositing a film of metal (usually nickel alloy) onto a ceramic rod. These resistors are very stable with temperature and frequency, but cost more than the carbon film or carbon composition types. In some

instances, these resistors are cased in a ceramic tube instead of the usual plastic or epoxy coating. When a resistor is constructed so its value can be adjusted, it is called a variable resistor. Figure 6 shows the basic elements present in all variable resistors. First a resistive material is deposited on a non-conducting base. Next, stationary contacts are connected to each end of the resistive material. Finally, a moving contact or wiper is constructed to move along the resistive material and tap off the

desired resistance. There are many methods for constructing variable resistors, but they all contain these three basic principles.

Before

technology improved the process of manufacturing resistors, they were first made and then sorted. By sorting the values into groups that represented a 5% change in value, (resistor values are 10% apart), certain preferred values became the standard for the electronics industry. Table 1 shows the standard values for 5% resistors. Resistors are marked by using different colored rings around their body (see Figure 7). The first ring represents the first digit of the resistor’s value. The second ring represents the second digit of the

resistor’s value. The third ring tells you the power of ten to multiply by. The final and fourth ring represents the tolerance. For example, gold is for 5% resistors and silver for 10% resistors. This means the value of the resistor is guaranteed to be within 5% or 10% of the value marked. The colors in Table 2 are used to represent the numbers from 0 to 9. Note:  If the third ring is gold, you multiply the first two digits by 0.1 and if it is silver, by 0.01. This system can identify values from 0.1W to as high as

91 x 109, or 91,000,000,000W. The amount of power each resistor can handle is usually proportional to the size of the resistor.

When a capacitor has a difference in voltage (Electrical Pressure) between its two leads it is said to be charged. A capacitor is charged by forcing a one way (DC) current to flow through it for a short period of time. It can be discharged by letting an opposite direction current flow out of the capacitor. Consider for a moment the analogy of a water pipe that has a

rubber diaphragm sealing off each side of the pipe as shown in Figure 9. If the pipe had a plunger on one end, as shown in Figure 9, and the plunger was pushed toward the diaphragm, the water in the pipe would force the rubber to stretch out until the force of the rubber pushing back on the water was equal to the force of the plunger. You could say the pipe is charged and ready to push the plunger back. In fact, if the plunger is released it will move back to its original position. The pipe will then be discharged or with no

charge on the diaphragm. Capacitors act the same as the pipe in Figure 9. When a voltage (Electrical Pressure) is placed on one lead with respect to the other lead, electrons are forced to “pile up” on one of the capacitor’s plates until the voltage pushing back is equal to the voltage applied. The capacitor is then charged to the voltage. If the two leads of that capacitor are shorted, it would have the same effect as letting the plunger in Figure 9 move freely. The capacitor would rapidly discharge and the voltage across the two

leads would become zero (No Charge). What would happen if the plunger in Figure 9 was wiggled in and out many times each second? The water in the pipe would be pushed by the diaphragm then sucked back by the diaphragm. Since the movement of the water (Current) is back and forth (Alternating) it is called an Alternating Current or AC. The capacitor will therefore pass an alternating current with little resistance. When the push on the plunger was only toward the diaphragm, the water on the other end of the diaphragm moved just

enough to charge the pipe (transient current). Just as the pipe blocked a direct push, a capacitor clocks direct current (DC). An example of alternating current is the 60 cycle (60 wiggles each second) current produced when you plug something into a wall outlet. SUMMARY: A capacitor stores electrical energy when charged by a DC source. It can pass alternating current (AC), but blocks direct current (DC) except for a very short charging current, called transient current. CAPACITORS Pipe Filled with Water

Rubber Diaphragm Sealing Center of Pipe Plunger Figure 9 -7- CAPACITORS, How are they made? There are many different types of capacitors used in electronics. Each type is made from different materials and with different methods. Capacitors are also made to handle different amounts of electrical pressure or voltage. Each capacitor is marked to show the maximum voltage that it can withstand without breaking down. All capacitors contain the same fundamental parts, which consist of two or more conductive

plates separated by a nonconductive material. The insulating material between the plates is called the dielectric. The basic elements necessary to build a capacitor are shown in Figure 10. Perhaps the most common form of capacitor is constructed by tightly winding two foil metal plates that are separated by sheets of paper or plastic as shown in Figure 11. By picking the correct insulating material the value of capacitance can be increased greatly, but the maximum working voltage is usually lowered. For this reason, capacitors are normally

identified by the type of material used as the insulator or dielectric. Consider the water pipe with the rubber diaphragm in the center of the pipe. The diaphragm is equivalent to the dielectric in a capacitor. If the rubber is made very soft, it will stretch out and hold a large amount of water, but it will break easily (large capacitance, but low working voltage). If the rubber is made very stiff, it will not stretch far, but will be able to withstand higher pressure (low capacitance, but high working

voltage). By making the pipe larger and keeping the stiff rubber we can achieve a device that holds a large amount of water and withstands a high amount of pressure (high capacitance, high working voltage, large size). These three types of water pipes are illustrated in Figure 12. The pipes follow the rule that the capacity to hold water, (Capacitance) multiplied by the amount of pressure they can take (Voltage) determines the size of the pipe. In electronics the CV product determines the capacitor size.

The dielectric (rubber diaphragm in the water pipe analogy) in a capacitor is the material that can withstand electrical pressure (Voltage) without

appreciable conduction (Current). When a voltage is applied to a capacitor, energy in the form of an electric charge is held by the dielectric. In the rubber diaphragm analogy the rubber would stretch out and hold the water back. The energy was stored in the rubber. When the plunger is released the rubber would release this energy and push the plunger back toward its original position. If there was no energy lost in the rubber diaphragm, all the energy would be recovered and the plunger would return to

its original position. The only perfect dielectric for a capacitor in which no conduction occurs and from which all the stored energy may be recovered is a perfect vacuum. The DIELECTRIC CONSTANT (K) is the ratio by which the capacitance is increased when another dielectric replaces a vacuum between two plates. Table 3 shows the Dielectric Constant of various materials. To make a variable capacitor, one set of stationary aluminum plates are mounted to a frame with a small space between each plate. Another set of

plates are mounted to a movable shaft and designed to fit into the space of the fixed plates without touching them. The insulator or dielectric in this type of variable capacitor is air. When the movable plates are completely inside the fixed plates, the device is at minimum capacitance. The shape of the plates can be designed to achieve the proper amount of capacitance versus rotation for different applications. An additional screw is added to squeeze two insulated metal plates together (Trimmer) and thus set the minimum amount of

capacitance.

In practice, one farad is a very large amount of capacitance, making the most common term used micro-farad or

one millionth of a farad. There are three factors that determine the capacitance that exist between two conductive plates: 1. The bigger the plates are (Surface Area), the higher the capacitance. Capacitance (C) is directly proportional to Area (A). 2. The larger the distance is between the two plates, the smaller the amount of capacitance. Capacitance (C) is indirectly proportional to distance (d). 3. The larger the value of the dielectric constant, the more capacitance (Dielectric constant is equivalent to softness of the

rubber in our pipe analogy). The capacitance (C) is directly proportional to the Dielectric Constant (K) of the insulating material. From the above factors, the formula for capacitance in Farads becomes: C = 0.244K            Picofarads * C = Capacitance in Picofarads (Farad x 10-12) K = Dielectric Constant A = Area of one Plate in square inches N = Number of Plates d = Distance between plates in inches Example Calculation for Capacitor shown in Figure 14. C = 2.24 x (1 x 1)(2 - 1) / (.01) = 224 Picofarads or

0.000224 Microfarads. * If A and d are in centimeters change 0.224 to 0.0885. The older styles of capacitors were marked with colored dots or rings similar to resistors. In recent years, the advances in technology has made it easier to print the value, working voltage, tolerance, and temperature characteristics on the body of the capacitors. Certain capacitors use a dielectric that requires markings to insure one lead is always kept at a higher voltage than the other lead. Figure 15 shows typical markings found on different types of

capacitors. Table 4 gives the standard values used and the different methods for marking these values. -9- CAPACITANCE, How is it calculated?

Voltages may be marked directly (200V) or coded (2D). The value of capacitance may be marked directly on the part as shown in columns 4 and 5 (note that .001mF and 1000mF have the same marking, but the difference in size makes the value obvious). The number 102 may also be used to represent 1000 (10+2 zeros). In some instances the manufacturer may use an R to represent the

decimal point. The tolerance is usually printed directly on the capacitors. When it is omitted, the standard tolerance is assumed to be +80% to –20% for electrolytics. Capacitance change with temperature is coded in parts per million per degree C, {N220 = 220/1,000,000 or .022%}, or by a temperature graph. See manufacturers specifications for complete details. CAPACITOR SYMBOLS Figure 16 shows the schematic symbols used to represent capacitors. The + symbol indicates that the capacitor is polarized and the lead marked with the + sign must always

have a higher voltage than the other lead. The curved plate, plate with sides, and minus sign also indicate the capacitor is polarized and these leads must always be at a lower voltage than the other lead. The arrow crossing through the capacitor indicates of capacitance is variable. Figure 16 + – Standard Variable Polarized -11- CAPACITORS SELF TEST 1.

Polarized (Y/N) Other Markings Figure 17 10mF 20mF ? mF Table 4 -12- INDUCTORS INDUCTORS, What do they do? The electronic component known as the inductor is best described as electrical momentum. In our water pipe analogy the inductor would be equivalent to a very long hose that is wrapped around itself many times (see Figure 18). If the hose is very long it will contain many gallons of water. When pressure is applied to one end of the hose, the thousands of gallons of water would not start to move instantly. It

would take time to get the water moving due to inertia (a body at rest wants to stay at rest). After a while the water would start to move and pick up speed. The speed would increase until the friction of the hose applied to the amount of pressure being applied to the water. If you try to instantly stop the water from moving by holding the plunger, the momentum (a body in motion wants to stay in motion) of the water would cause a large negative pressure (Suction) that would pull the plunger from

your hands. Since Inductors are made by coiling a wire, they are often called Coils. In practice the names Inductor and Coil are used interchangeably. From the above analogy, it is obvious that a coiled hose will pass Direct Current (DC), since the water flow increases to equal the resistance in the coiled hose after an elapsed period of time. If the pressure on the plunger is alternated (pushed, then pulled) fast enough, the water in the coil will never start moving and the Alternating Current (AC) will be blocked.

The nature of a Coil in electronics follows the same principles as the coiled hose analogy. A coil of wire will pass DC and block AC. Recall that the nature of a Capacitor blocked DC and passed AC, the exact opposite of a coil. Because of this, the Capacitor and Inductor are often called Dual Components. Table 5 compares the properties of capacitors and inductors.

In order to understand how inductors are made, we have to change our water pipe analogy slightly to include the effect of magnetic fields. Consider two

pipes filled with water and small magnets attached to the walls of the pipes with rubber bands as shown in Figure 19. The moving magnets, due to the original current, pull the magnets in the second pipe and force a small current to flow in the same direction as the original current. When the rubber bands are fully stretched, the induced current will stop, even though the initial DC current is still flowing. If the original current is an AC current however, it will induce a continuous AC current in

the second pipe because the magnets will move back and forth, pulling the magnets in the second pipe back and forth. Consider the two coiled pipes shown in Figure 20. When the pipe is stretched out (increased length) as in coil 1, the adjacent turns have little affect on each other. In coil 2 (decreased length) the magnets in each turn of the pipe are linking and the amount of “apparent mass” in the pipe seems to increase. In an inductor, pushing the coiled wire closer together causes the inductance of the coil to also increase,

and stretching the coil out will lower the inductance of the coil. In other words, the inductance of a coil is indirectly proportional to its length. If the diameter of the coil is increased, it will take more hose to form a loop, and the amount of water will therefore increase. More water means a larger “apparent mass”. Inductance will also increase in a coil if the cross sectional area increases. Inductance is directly proportional to area. Consider the affect of adding more turns to coiled pipe. The amount of material to push (mass) is

increased and the amount of linkage is increased due to more magnets available. This causes the “apparent mass” to increase at a greater rate than would be expected. When making an inductor, the actual inductance is directly proportional to the square of the number of turns. The final factor to consider when making a coil is the core material at the center of the coil. If our pipe wrapped around a material that contained many magnets, they would also link to the magnets in the pipe. This would increase the “apparent

mass” of the water in the pipe. The tiny magnets in the core would rotate as shown in Figure 21 and force the water to keep moving in the same direction. Placing an iron core at the center of an inductor will directly increase the inductance by an amount equal to the permeability of the core material. INDUCTORS Figure 20 Figure 21 Coil 1 Coil 2 Many tiny magnets IN OUT Figure 19 Induced Current Initial Current -14- INDUCTORS INDUCTANCE, How is it calculated? Reviewing how coils are made will show the

following: 1. Inductance of a coil is indirectly proportional to the length of the coil. 2. Inductance is directly proportional to the cross sectional area. 3. Inductance is proportional to the square of the number of turns. 4. Inductance is directly proportional to the permeability of the core material. From the above information the formula for inductance of a simple iron core would be: L = Where: L = Inductance in microhenrys N = Number of turns m = Permeability of core material A = Cross-sectional area of coil, in square inches

l = Length of coil in inches This formula is good only for solid core coils with length greater than diameter. N2mA 10l TRANSFORMERS, How are they made? Placing different coils on the same iron core as shown in Figure 22 produces the electronic component known as the Transformer. If a DC current is forced through the center coil, the other two coils will only produce a current when the original current is changing. Once the DC current reaches a constant value, the other two coils will “unlink” and produce no flowing current if loaded. If

the generator voltage is continuously changing as in Figure 22, it will produce a current that changes with time. This changing current in the center coil will produce similar currents in both of the end coils. Since the bottom coil has twice the number of turns (twice the magnetic linkage), the voltage across this coil will be twice the generator voltage. The power in an electronic device is equal to the voltage across the device times the current through the device (P=VI). If the voltage doubles on the bottom

winding, then the current must become 1/2 due to the law of conservation of power (Power cannot be created or destroyed, but can be transformed from one state to another). Since the bottom coil is wound in the same direction as the generator coil, the voltage across the coil (top wire to bottom wire) will be the same polarity as the generator voltage. The top coil is wound in the opposite direction forcing the core magnet rotation (Called flux by the Pros) to push the current in the opposite direction

and produce a voltage of the opposite polarity. Since the number of turns in the top coil are the same as the generator coil, the voltage and current (Power that can be taken from the coil) will also be equal. This ability to transform AC voltages and AC currents influenced early experimenters to call this device a Transformer.

Faraday’s Law states that any time a conductor moves through a magnetic field (Figure 23) a voltage is generated. Because of this principle, it is possible to attach a magnet (or coil) to a rotating device and produce large amounts of electrical power (the Hoover Dam for example). Lenz’ Law states that the induced currents in a conductor passing through a magnetic field will produce a magnetic field that will oppose the motion between the magnet and the conductor. To produce a large amount of electrical power, a large

mechanical force is required (conservation of power). Most inductors are custom made to meet the requirements of the purchaser. They are marked to match the specification of the buyer and therefore carry no standard markings. The schematic symbols for coils and transformers are shown in Figure 24. These symbols are the most commonly used to represent fixed coils, variable coils, and transformers. The Q (figure of merit) of a coil is the ratio of the inductive reactance to the internal series resistance

of the coil. Since the reactance and resistance can both change with frequency, Q must be measured at the desired frequency. Anything that will raise the inductance without raising the series resistance will increase the Q of the coil; for example, using an iron core. Lowering the series resistance without lowering the inductance will also raise the Q, more turns of larger wire for example. Q is important when the inductor is used in a resonant circuit to block or select desired frequencies. The higher the Q, the

tighter the selection of frequencies become. The Inductor prevents current from making any sudden changes by producing large opposing voltages. Magnetic coupling can be used to transform voltages and currents, but power must remain the same. Coils and transformers can be used to select frequencies.

The diode can be compared to the check valve shown in Figure 26. The basic function of a check

valve is to allow water to flow in only one direction. Once the force of the spring is exceeded, the plate moves away from the stop allowing water to pass through the pipe. A flow of water in the opposite direction is blocked by the solid stop and plate. If it took a pressure of 0.7lb to exceed the spring force, the flow of water versus pressure might look like Figure 27. In electronics, this curve would represent the typical silicon diode if pounds per square inch equaled volts and gallons per minute equaled

amperes. Of course, the amount of current that flows through the diode must be limited or the device could be damaged. Just as too much water through the check valve could destroy the plate (shorted diode). If the diode is made of Gallium Arsenide, it would take approximately twice the voltage to produce a flow of current (spring in Figure 26 is twice as strong). The energy level required to “turn on” a Gallium Arsenide diode is so high, that light is generated when current starts to flow. These diodes

are called “Light Emitting Diodes”, or simply LEDs. The transistor is best described as a device that uses a small amount of current to control a large amount of current (Current Amplifier). Consider a device fabricated as shown in Figure 28. A small amount of “Base Current” pushes on the L1 portion of the lever arm forcing check valve D1 to open, even though it is “reverse biased” (pressure is in direction to keep check valve shut). Keep in mind the base current would not start to flow until the

check valve D2 allowed current to flow (0.7lb). If the current ratio through D1 and Base was equal to the lever arm advantage, then I1 / Ib = L1 / L2. Call this ratio Beta (b) and let L1 = 1 inch and L2 = 0.01 inch. Then b = 100 and I1 will be 100 times Ib. Since both currents must pass through D2, I2 = I1 + Ib. These same principles apply to a silicon NPN transistor. I1 becomes collector current (IC), and I2 would be emitter current (IE). b = IC / IB and IE = IB + IC. THE TRANSISTOR, what is it?

Spring Solid Stop Movable Plate Water-tight Pivot Figure 26 Figure 27 0.7 Pressure (lbs per square inch) Current (gals. per min.) Figure 28 Base Current Ib L1 L2 I1 D1 D2 I2 Lever Arm NPN Transistor Pivot -18- SEMICONDUCTORS THE PNP TRANSISTOR Figure 29 represents the water pipe equivalent of a PNP transistor. The emitter releases current that splits into two paths. The base current “forces open” the collector check valve which collects all the current except the small amount that goes into the base. The direction of current in the PNP transistor

is opposite that of the NPN transistor. Because of these differences, the emitter of the PNP is usually referenced to the power supply voltage and the emitter of the NPN is usually referenced to ground or zero voltage. In both transistors, the current amplification factor (Ic/Ib) is called Beta (b). In Figure 30 the center of a small section of a pipe is made of thin, flexible rubber and that rubber is surrounded by water from a third pipe called the gate. When pressure is applied to the gate, the

rubber pinches off the current from the source to the drain. No current flows from gate to drain or source. This device uses a change in gate pressure to control the current flowing from source to drain. Since there are no check valves, the current can flow in either direction. In other words, this device acts like a variable resistor. The Field Effect Transistor (FET) also controls current between source and drain by “pinching off” the path between them. The level of voltage on the gate controls the

amount of current that will flow. Since no DC current flows in or out of the gate (only momentarily a small amount will flow to adjust to new pressures as in a capacitor), the power used by the gate is very close to zero. Remember, power equals voltage times current, and if the current is zero, the power is zero. This is why FETs are used in the probes of test equipment. They will not disturb the circuit being tested by removing power during a measurement. When a second gate section is added (pipe and

rubber) between the source and drain it is called a Dual Gate FET. In our water pipe analogy of the FET transistor, the rubber must be very thin and flexible in order to “pinch off” the current from the source to the drain. This means it could be easily damaged by a small “spike” of high pressure. The same is true of an electronic FET. A high voltage “spike” (Static Electricity) can destroy the gate and ruin the FET. To protect the FET, they are sometimes packaged with metal rings shorting their leads, and a fourth lead

may be added to the metal case containing the transistor.

Figure 31 represents such a device. This block of steel would have to be very large to

include all the mechanical parts needed. In electronics, the actual size of a diode or transistor is extremely small. In fact, millions can be fabricated on a piece of silicon no larger than the head of a pin. Photographic reduction techniques are used to generate the masking needed to isolate each part. These masks are then stepped and repeated in order to make many separate integrated circuits at the same time on a single substrate. Using mass production techniques, these circuits are manufactured, packaged, and sold at prices much

lower than the equivalent discreet circuit would cost. SEMICONDUCTOR SYMBOLS Figure 32 shows the common symbols used in electronics to represent the basic components.

1000W Resistor 9V Battery -21- MECHANICAL PARTS PRINTED CIRCUIT BOARDS, What are they? A printed circuit is a conductive pattern glued to one or both sides of an insulating material. Holes are punched or drilled through the conductor and board to allow the interconnection of electronic parts. In the case of a double sided board, the holes are plated to provide a connection between the conductors on both sides of the board. This method provides considerable space savings over hand wiring and allows for automated insertion and

soldering of parts. A more uniform product is produced because wiring errors are eliminated. The insulating material thickness may vary from 0.015” to 0.500”. The most widely used base material is NEMA-XXXP paper base phenolic. Copper is the most common conductive material glued to the base. The common thicknesses of the copper foil are 0.0014” (1 oz./sq. ft.) and 0.0028” (2 oz./sq. ft.). For single sided boards, the copper is laminated to the board and then screened and etched away. Double sided boards use a plating process and

conductive ink to achieve the desired layout. Figure 34 Insulating Material Wrong Copper Correct DESIGN RULES After a the breadboard has been tested, there are some design rules used to layout the printed circuit board. A few of these basic rules are listed here: 1. Diameter of punched holes should not be less than 2/3 the board thickness. 2. Distance between punched holes or between holes and board edge should not be less than the board thickness. 3. Holes should not exceed more than 0.020” of the

diameter of the wire to be inserted in the hole (machine insertion may require more, but leads should be “clinched”). 4. Conductor widths should be large enough to carry current peaks. A width of one tenth of an inch (1 oz./sq. ft. copper) will increase in temperature 10OC at a DC current of 5A. 5. Conductor spacing must be capable of withstanding applied voltages. If a voltage difference of 500 volts exists between two copper runs, they must be separated by at leads 0.03” to prevent breakdown. 6. Avoid the use of sharp corners when laying out

copper (see Figure 34). Sharp corners produce high electric fields that can lower breakdown. Sharp corners will also make it easier for copper to peel from the board. 7. Heavy parts must be mounted to prevent board damage if the unit is dropped. 8. The printed circuit board must be fastened to prevent leads from touching the case or any other object mounted near the board. 9. Mounting hardware must be designed to prevent board stress (warping or excessive torque). Note: The PC board is included with this kit is only

a sample and will not be assembled. -22- MECHANICAL PARTS THE TOP LEGEND The component side of a printed circuit board should always have a drawing showing the placement of the parts and their schematic marking (R1, R2, etc.). This drawing is called the Top Legend. When a board needs to be repaired, the schematic becomes the “road map” and the top legend becomes the “address” on the part. Figure 35 shows the correlation between the Schematic and the Top Legend. Different parts have been discussed. A printed

circuit board to interconnect these parts has been discussed. Now it’s time to talk about the “Electronic Glue” called Solder. Soldering wire is composed of Tin and Copper with a rosin or acid core. Acid core solder should never be used on electronic boards since the acid will damage the components. Acid core solder is mainly used to attach metals (copper water pipes for example). When tin and copper are mixed, the melting point of the mixture is lower than the melting point of either tin or copper. The point at

which the melting point is the lowest is when the mixture equals 99.3% tin and 0.7% copper. This is called the eutectic (u tek’tik) point of the mixture. The most common flux placed at the center of this hollow wire alloy is Rosin based. Removing the flux from the board requires a chemical that can dissolve rosin. In recent years many water soluble fluxes have been developed. These fluxes can be removed by washing the boards in water. After the parts are placed in the holes on the printed circuit board, their leads should be trimmed and

bent. A good mechanical connection will improve the soldering capability of the parts by forcing the part and copper on the board to rise to the same temperature. Positioning the soldering iron correctly and using the right amount of heat are crucial to a good solder job. Solder practicing is highly recommended (Elenco® Solder Practice Kit Model SP-1A). SOLDER, The Electronic Glue Figure 35 Schematic Printed Circuit Board R1 C1 R2 B+ T1 D1 C2 Q1 R1 C1 R2 T1 D1 C2 Q1 There are many other mechanical parts used by

manufacturers of electronic equipment. Most of them fall into the category of switching or connecting circuits. In Figure 36, five of the six parts shown are used to switch or connect signals to the printed circuit board. Only the spacer falls into a different category, called mounting. The switch is used to redirect current or voltage from one circuit to another. The wire nut is used to hold two twisted wires together and insulate them (prevent them from being bare and exposed) at the same time. The PC

board male and female connectors are used to attach wires from controls or other circuits to the printed circuit board. The Earphone Jack is used to bring a signal from the printed circuit board to an earphone. The spacer holds the printed circuit board away from the case to prevent leads from shorting to the case. There are many different methods for mounting printed circuit boards. The simplest method is using machine screws and spacers. Figure 37 shows some of the common screw heads used by electronic manufacturers. The oval head screw in

Figure 37 has a tapered end that will cut into the metal and make a thread for the body of the screw. The self-threading screw eliminates the need for a nut and lockwasher but can produce metal fragments that must be removed to prevent shorts from occurring. -23- MECHANICAL PARTS OTHER MECHANICAL PARTS MOUNTING HARDWARE Figure 37 Round Head Pan Head Fillister Head Flat Head Oval Head Self-threading Figure 36 Switch Wire Nut Female Connector Earphone Jack Female Spacer PC Board Male Connector -24-

of possibilities for product design and manufacturing. The first material for that printer was a mix of wax and plastic. Over the next 30 years, material scientists developed a range of new and exotic materials, while hardware and software advancements in 3D printing enabled the use of these new materials. Most of the early 3D printers and materials developed were only available to companies who could afford their six-figure (or more) price tags, but recently there has been a renaissance in which major material

manufacturers are flocking to the space. With that popularity, a wealth of new materials are being developed and optimized for 3D printers. While some of these materials print spectacularly, others still have a ways to go in terms of reliability, print quality, or material performance. Some materials are extremely affordable and others can be costly. With all of these options and variables, it can be daunting to someone who is relatively new to 3D printing. For that reason, we’ve created a guide that will take you through the ins and outs of FDM 3D printing materials,

when to use them, and what to expect along the way.

On the METHOD platform alone there are 25 materials (and counting) that users can choose from to ensure that they always have the right material for the job at hand. With dual extrusion, you have the ability to introduce dissolvable supports, enabling even more complex geometries. And with MakerBot LABS,

users can leverage an unlimited sea of third-party materials - including those verified through the LABS program and listed here!

and works well with breakaway supports which print faster and can be removed faster than dissolvable supports. PLA is a corn-based plastic and is considered biodegradable under industrial processes. PLA is strong in tensile strength and modulus relative to other base polymers, which may be surprising to some because it is generally viewed as a fairly basic material. One potential downside of PLA is its brittleness – if it fails, it fractures catastrophically whereas some of the other polymers may bend.

Parts: 3D Laser Scanner Support: Breakaway Support Print Time: 23h 58m Model Materials POLYMERS The model material is simply the material that you want your final part - whether it’s a prototype, a tool, or a working product - to be manufactured in. In the case of FDM 3D printing with the MakerBot METHOD Series we categorize these materials into three families - polymers, composites, and metals. PAGE 8 2022 GUIDE TO 3D PRINTING MATERIALS PETG Chemical Resistant, Durable TOUGH MATERIAL Fast, Easy, Durable

Tough is a relatively new category of material that has a PLA base with modifiers to increase its tensile modulus to make it more impact-resistant. The combination of ease of use, office-friendliness, and durability / machinability make it great for mid-stage prototypes. Tough has an incredibly high elongation before break making it highly durable – this can be seen when printing extremely thin living hinges, which can be bent back and flexed many times before breaking. While highly durable, Tough can

lack the higher quality surface and detail finish of both PLA and ABS. PETG’s (glycol-modified polyethylene terephthalate) chemical resistance makes it a choice material for liquid containers and bottles, which also makes it great for prototyping those types of products. While available in a range of colors, PETG’s glycol addition removes haziness to give it a nice translucence. The glycol also increases the strength and heat-resistance compared to PET. In addition to containers, the liquid / chemical resistance can benefit

a range of uses from the machine shop to the lab. This vacuum nozzle was printed as an attachment for a shop vac for removing waste material from a CNC machine. PETG is a great choice for this application due to the material’s chemical resistance to the CNC coolant.

most popular materials for injection molded consumer products due to its clean surface finish, durability, and heat resistance. For this reason, it is often used for prototyping consumer products that will later be injection molded. By using ABS, the prototype is more likely to look, feel, and perform like the final product. ABS’s durability and high heat deflection temperature also make it a good material for use in the lab or on the factory floor. ABS-R is a newer formulation of ABS with improved

performance characteristics and reliability. It was developed specifically by MakerBot to be compatible with RapidRinse - a water soluble material that reduces post-print dissolution time from hours to minutes. In testing ABS-R has shown to increase print reliability from the already reliable ABS by 98%. Like ABS, ABS-R is a choice material for prototyping in advance of injection molding production with ABS, but is also durable and can be used for end use parts.

Because the use of ASA is fairly common in production parts for

these industries, the prototyping of the same parts in ASA allows test engineers to better understand how their products will hold up in extreme weather conditions. In the field, a utility worker or a farmer could benefit from printing replacement parts as needed for broken equipment. Parts: Electrical Outlet Cover Support: Stratasys® SR-30 Print Time: 4h 29m NYLON Abrasion-Resistant, Strong Nylon’s ability to withstand high temperatures and its durability combine to give it above average abrasion

resistance. While the storage of replacement parts can be costly, the ability to instead store the CAD file and print the parts as needed is an alternative that can save space and provide flexibility. Gears take consistent punishment and high abrasion, making Nylon an ideal material for this type of part.

classic definition of a composite for 3D printing materials tends to refer to a polymer that has been reinforced with a solid particle (fibers, glass beads, etc.).  If you use ABS, you might want to check out PC-ABS. It has many of the properties that make ABS desirable with added strength and heat-resistance beyond the range of regular ABS and thus is a common material used in the automotive industry. Parts: Train Car Handle Support: SR-30 Print Time: 14h 01m PC-ABS FR Durable, Heat Resistant, and Flame Retardant

Preventing or slowing the spread of fire can be important in many testing or end-use applications. By modifying a base polymer like PC-ABS, it is possible to 3D print parts that are not only strong, but also have extinguishing properties that prevent flames. FR is an important characteristic for parts made for the automotive, railway, and aerospace industries.

where rubber-like or elastomeric properties and durability are required. TPE SEBS 1300 95A is slightly firmer than TPE SEBS 1300 85A for application requirements that call for flexibility but also need more rigidity to achieve the optimal finished part performance.

The main thing about Nylon 6 that sets it apart from others in that category is its ability to withstand higher temperatures. The heat deflection temperature is significantly higher than many of the popular base polymers. In the case of

MakerBot Nylon Carbon Fiber, the HDT is 100°C higher than that of ABS and 93°C higher than regular Nylon 6. Parts: Sprinkler System Attachment Support: SR-30 Print Time: 8h 05m COMPOSITES NYLON 12 CARBON FIBER Much like Nylon 6 Carbon Fiber, the Nylon 12 variant has the benefits of strength, stiffness, and lightweight. Unlike Nylon 6, Nylon 12 has a better resistance to moisture uptake, making it somewhat easier to print and giving the printed part a cleaner final appearance without the need for post-processing. One drawback of Nylon 12 compared

to Nylon 6 is it will generally have a lower HDT - so you really just need to weigh what is most important for your specific application.

Parts: RPI Case Support: SR-30 Print Time: 10h 28m LABS PAGE 19 2022 GUIDE TO 3D PRINTING MATERIALS BASF ULTRAFUSE 316L STAINLESS STEEL Metal 3D Printing Process PRINT SEND IN YOUR GREEN PART RECEIVE SOLID METAL PART Ultrafuse 316L is a unique FDM material that allows for users to produce real, solid 316L stainless steel parts. In filament form it is a bound material (ie. metal

powder suspended within an ABS-like polymer). This allows for relatively easy use with FDM 3D printers such as the MakerBot METHOD. Upon completion of the print, a green part must then go through a debinding and sintering process in which the binder material is removed, and the remaining metal material is sintered together to form the final solid metal part. The resulting part can withstand forces and temperatures far beyond the threshold of polymers or composites, making it an extremely valuable option for certain end parts.

Launch your print from anywhere via MakerBot CloudPrint to your personal or team-shared METHOD 3D printer equipped with a LABS GEN 2 Extruder and BASF Ultrafuse 316L material. You receive the solid steel part in as little as 5 days - up to half the time and ⅕the cost of a typical 3D printing service bureau. Install the part as needed or incorporate with other printed parts in MakerBot composites and polymers for a more dynamic assembly. Once your “Green” part is complete, send it in to your sintering service provider

such as Matterhackers where parts are debinded and sintered in a high heat, pure hydrogen atmosphere resulting in pure 316L Stainless Steel. Parts: Planetary Gear Hub Support: n/a Print Time: 10h 15m METALS PAGE 20 2022 GUIDE TO 3D PRINTING MATERIALS Whether you’re working with FDM, SLA, SLS, or another type of 3D printer, unless you’re printing in space, you have to account for gravity. If you’re printing something like a solid cube, this isn’t really an issue because each layer has a corresponding layer

beneath it for support. But what if you have an object that has portions of the model that are essentially floating in midair with no structure directly underneath them? This is where removable supports come into play. Depending on the type of FDM 3D printer you are working with, there are a few good options you can use. Tap-Water Soluble Support Material for ABS Print dimensionally accurate ABS parts with the ease of PLA. Print your parts with confidence in ABS-R and RapidRinse™, drop your part into tap water, and watch

the supports dissolve to nothing in just minutes. Parts: Gear with Extended Shaft Support: RapidRinse Print Time: 4h 33m ABS, FINALLY AS EASY AS PLA TAP WATER SOLUBLE DISSOLVES IN MINUTES* With our proprietary RapidRinse™ support achieve incomparable ABS parts with unprecedented ease. You don’t have time to wait around while your print dissolves, so we’ve engineered RapidRinse™ to dissolve faster than PVA and competitive high-temp dissolvable support materials. Forget the cumbersome wash tanks and

chemicals, RapidRinse™ dissolves in pure tap water so it’s easy to use in just about any environment. *Dissolution time may vary based on part geometry and dissolution methodology Support Materials Enabling the most complex geometries RAPIDRINSE PAGE 21 2022 GUIDE TO 3D PRINTING MATERIALS SR-30 SR-30 is a proprietary material developed by Stratasys to work seamlessly with ABS, ASA, and various other high- temp materials. Because of this focused development, using SR-30 with these typically more challenging

materials can yield exceptional results that wouldn’t be possible with something like PVA, which is very difficult to use with ABS. Like PVA, SR-30 is dissolvable and can enable extreme complexity of geometry while maintaining excellent surface finish at the support site. Unlike PVA, SR-30 requires a specialty solvent along with heat, to efficiently dissolve. Users of SR-30 will need to invest in additional equipment, and possibly use in a more controlled environment like a lab. Parts: Robotic Sander

Support: SR-30 Print Time: 17h 20m PVA PVA (polyvinyl alcohol) is a water soluble support material that is compatible with many lower temperature model materials such as PLA and PETG. Printing PVA alongside a model material requires at least two extruders so you’ll need a printer with dual extrusion for this. Because PVA is water soluble, it is extremely office-friendly - you can place your part in water and after a few hours, the supports will dissolve. Using a dissolvable material like PVA allows you to create much more complex parts

because the solvent (in this case water) can reach deep within channels and crevices of the part. It also can reduce the damage caused to the print, which might be more prevalent when using breakaway supports. Parts: Ski Goggles Support: PVA Print Time: 14h 16m Water Soluble Soluble support for high temperature polymers PAGE 22 2022 GUIDE TO 3D PRINTING MATERIALS BREAKAWAY Using Model Material Breakaway supports aren’t so much a type of material, but rather a software trick in which the slicing program fills in the

void below the model with a removable structure printed in the same material. Breakaway supports are popular because they can use the same material as the printed model with a single extruder (as opposed to dissolvable supports requiring a second extruder and material). The quality of the print then depends on a couple of variables. The first is dependent on the slicing algorithm. A good slicer will ensure that the prints are well supported, but also leave a seam along which a clean break can be made. The second

thing to consider is which material is being used. A hard, rigid plastic like PLA is really best for this because it is more apt to having a clean fracture whereas a less rigid plastic will bend and tear when removing support, leaving remnants on the model part. Parts: Bicycle Front Stem Support: Breakaway Print Time: 7h 12m BREAKAWAY Using Support Material For certain model materials, using the primary material as model AND support isn’t really feasible. This can be due to a variety of reasons, but most commonly you’ll find issues

when the material is less rigid and more pliable. ABS is one example of a material where you may have a more difficult time because removal of the ABS supports is more of a tearing action than fracturing. This can leave unwanted artifacts on your print. Thus there is an option to use a different material (either model or support) loaded in the second extruder as a breakaway material. You may find settings to do just this and it can allow the user to use a more pliable material in a situation where they want the

post-processing speed offered by breakaway supports. Parts: Bicycle Pedal Support: SR-30 Breakaway Print Time: 10h 34m PAGE 23 2022 GUIDE TO 3D PRINTING MATERIALS While FDM (also known as FFF) is a specific category of 3D printers, that doesn’t mean all FDM 3D printers are created equally. Within the family of FDM, costs can range from $200 to $200,000. While the most basic 3D printing technology is a build plate, with an extruder and a gantry, there are many things you can do to improve print quality, material diversity, complexity, and more. For this section, we’re going to focus

on the industrial processes and features that enable the MakerBot METHOD to print with a unique blend of speed, dimensional accuracy, and reliability. We’ll go in chronological order from initial development through to final print. DUAL PERFORMANCE DRY-SEALED CIRCULATING HEATED CHAMBER TOUCHSCREEN ULTRA-RIGID METAL FRAME CONSTRUCTION SENSORS + CONNECTIVITY SPRING STEEL BUILD PLATE SMART SPOOLS AND SMART ASSIST MATERIAL LOADER DISSOLUBLE  SUPPORT SYSTEM Not All 3D Printers are Equal: 5 Things that Allow MakerBot METHOD

to Print Materials Better PAGE 24 2022 GUIDE TO 3D PRINTING MATERIALS 1. Testing and Optimization Once the decision is made to optimize a new material for the METHOD platform, MakerBot typically works with a material supplier to get samples and suggested settings. From there, a collaborative effort between MakerBot’s software development team and test engineering group will develop and optimize slicing profiles that will yield best results in part quality, surface finish, dimensional accuracy, and print time. Depending on

the material type, this process can take up to several months. During the optimization, ABR tests are conducted across dozens of printers to ensure consistency of these settings while printing some of the most challenging geometries. These tests can be grueling and push the printers to their limits to find the limits of both the hardware and the material, and ensure the user will have a good experience when they print with the new material. PRINTER OPTIMIZATION TORTURE TESTING PAGE 25 2022 GUIDE TO 3D PRINTING MATERIALS

2. Shipping and Handling Once the material is manufactured, it is spooled up and bagged. METHOD utilizes the Smart Spool system, which is a purpose-built spool that contains sensors read by the printer when loaded into the material bay. The RFID chips contain information about the material type, color, amount remaining on the spool, etc. This information allows the printer to use the optimized print settings with the material type, further streamlining the user experience. The spools are shipped in resealable mylar bags, which are impermeable to light and

moisture and help protect the filament from potential damage. Within the spool there is also desiccant to keep the environment moisture-free. SMART SPOOL / MYLAR BAG Sealed Metalized Polyester Bag PAGE 26 2022 GUIDE TO 3D PRINTING MATERIALS 3. Loading and Storing Once the spool is loaded into the drawer of the material bay, you only need to insert the tip of the filament into the material slot. The printer recognizes the presence of filament and will do the rest of the work loading the filament up the routing tube and into the

extruder. This hands-free process is not only convenient for users but also prevents the user from accidentally adjusting a calibrated extruder. Once material starts loading, the drawers on the material bays can be closed. The two Dry-Sealed Material Bays are sealed from the outside environment. This seal, combined with the desiccant cartridge of the Smart Spool, ensures that the material is stored in a low-humidity environment even during printing and in between prints. A sensor in the bay can show the humidity

level within the bay and humidity levels can be tracked across Smart Spools. Protection from humidity is especially important when printing with materials like Nylon and PVA – both of which are prone to absorb moisture which can cause damage to the end print. SMART ASSIST MATERIAL LOADER DRY-SEALED MATERIAL BAYS PAGE 27 2022 GUIDE TO 3D PRINTING MATERIALS 4. Printing METHOD has two extruders – one for model material and one for support material. These extruders are packed with a sensor suite and chip set that enable them to accurately

control print temperature so as not to damage materials. The sensor suite also includes active jam detection, and auto- stop when filament runs out. With a range of temperatures, METHOD’s extruders can handle higher temp materials such as ABS and ASA, or when active cooling is turned on, single extrusion low temp materials can be printed with ease. PERFORMANCE EXTRUDERS One of the marquee features of METHOD that distinguishes it from other 3D printer options in its price class is the Circulating

Heated Build Chamber. Using two active heat exchangers on either side of the printer, METHOD warms the chamber temperature from 40°C and 100°C depending on the material. By creating a consistent chamber temperature throughout, METHOD is able to achieve a printed part dimensional accuracy within ±0.007in (±0.2mm) of the CAD design. The added heat also increases the strength of the bond between vertical layer lines – giving the part strength on all three axes (not just two). CIRCULATING HEATED CHAMBER

PAGE 28 2022 GUIDE TO 3D PRINTING MATERIALS 5. Drying METHOD has the ability to dry spools using the heat within the Circulating Heated Chamber. This is great if you have a spool that’s been left out of the bag for a long period of time, or if the spool is older and the desiccant has become saturated. To run this function, use the touchscreen to navigate to Settings > Advanced and select Dry Filament. To take it one step further, get the Material Dry-Kit which includes a fresh bag and fresh desiccant. Putting your spool into the kit before running the dry cycle will improve the

results significantly.

Introduction 12 Original Prusa MK4S kit assembly STEP 9 We are here for you! Lost in the instructions, missing screw or cracked printed part? Let us know! You can contact us using the following channels:

Using comments under each step. Using our 24/7 live chat here at help.prusa3d.com Writing an email to info@prusa3d.com 1. Introduction Original Prusa MK4S kit assembly 13 STEP 10 Pro tip: inserting the nuts 3D printed parts are very precise, however, there still might be a tolerance in the printed part and the same goes for the size of the nut. Therefore it might happen, that the nut won't fit easily in or might be falling out. Let's see, how to fix it: Nut won't fit in: use a screw with a thread along its entire length (typically:

M3x10, M3x18) and screw it from the opposite side of the opening. While tightening the screw, the nut will be pulled in. Remove the screw afterwards. Alternative option: you can use X-holder tool included in the package. Insert any screw (typically: M3x10 or M3x18) and screw the nut fully on the tip of the thread. Push the nut into the printed part and remove the screw with X-holder. Nut keeps falling out: Use a piece of tape to fix the nut temporarily in place, as soon as you insert the screw in, you can remove the tape. Using glue isn't

recommended as it can partly reach into the thread and you won't be able to tighten the screw properly. Every time we recommend using the "screw pulling technique", you will be reminded with Joe's avatar ;) Parts in the pictures are used as an example. 1. Introduction 14 Original Prusa MK4S kit assembly STEP 11 Important: Electronics protection WARNING: Make sure to protect the electronics against electrostatic discharge (ESD). Always unpack the electronics right before you need them! Here are some tips to prevent damage to the electronics:

Keep the electronics inside the ESD bag right until you are asked to install them. Always touch the sides of the board only while handling it. Avoid touching the components on the surface. Before you touch the electronics use any conductive (metal) structure nearby to neutralize the possible static charge from your hands. Be extra cautious in rooms with carpets, which are often a source of electrostatic energy. Clothes made of wool or certain synthetic fabrics can easily gather static electricity too. It is safer to wear cotton clothing for the assembly.

1. Introduction Original Prusa MK4S kit assembly 15 STEP 12 Reward yourself Based on the feedback, building the MK4S printer is even more enjoyable compared to the MK4. However, you should still treat yourself for every finished chapter. Look in the box and find a bag of Haribo Bears. The biggest issue from our experience (MK4, MK3S+, MK3S, MK3, MK2S, ...) is inadequate bear consumption. Many of you didn't have enough gummy bears for all chapters, some even ate them all before they started! After years of thorough scientific research, we came to a solution => At the end of

each chapter, you will be told a specific amount of bears to consume. Eating an incorrect amount than prescribed in the manual might lead to a sudden boost of energy. Please consult a professional in the closest candy store. Hide the Haribo for now! From our experience, an unattended bag with sweets will suddenly disappear. Confirmed by multiple cases all around the World. 1. Introduction 16 Original Prusa MK4S kit assembly STEP 13 How to successfully finish the assembly To successfully finish the MK4S kit please follow all these:

Always read all the instructions at the current step first, it will help you to understand what you need to do. Don't cut or trim unless you are told to!!! Don't follow pictures only! It is not enough, the written instructions are as brief as they could be. Read them! Read the comments from the other users, they are great sources of ideas. We read them too and based on your feedback improved the manual and the entire assembly. Use a reasonable force, the printed parts are tough, but not unbreakable. If it

doesn't fit, check your approach twice. Eat the gummy bears as instructed! Disobedience won't be tolerated :D Most importantly: Enjoy the build, and have fun. Cooperate with your kids, friends or partners. 1. Introduction Original Prusa MK4S kit assembly 17 STEP 14 Additional Information This information applies to users planning to install accessories, such as the Original Prusa Enclosure, or upgrades like the MMU3. Before installing any accessories, it's essential to assemble and test your printer according to the instructions. Once the printer is fully functional,

follow the separate MMU3 or Enclosure assembly manual to modify the printer for installation. STEP 15 Prepare your desk Tidy up your desk! Tidying up decreases the probability of losing small parts. Clear your workspace. Make sure you have enough room. A nice clear flat workbench will get you the results you are aiming for. Let there be light! Make sure you are in a well-lit environment. Another lamp or even an extra flashlight will probably come in handy. Prepare something to contain the plastic bags and the removed packing materials

so you can recycle them afterwards. Make sure there are no important parts being discarded. OK, we are ready. Let's start! Go to chapter 2. Frame assembly 18 Original Prusa MK4S kit assembly 2. Frame assembly 2. Frame assembly Original Prusa MK4S kit assembly 19 STEP 1 Tools necessary for this chapter For this chapter, please prepare: 2.0mm Allen key for tightening the grub screws 2.5mm  Allen key for most of the M3 screws on the assembly 3mm Allen key for M5 screws used on the frame STEP 2 YZ frame: parts preparation

Prepare the following parts to build the YZ frame: Extrusion 3030 120 mm (2x) Extrusion 3030 205 mm (2x) Printer frame (1x) M5x16r screw (16x) Before you proceed further, please place the frame on a flat surface. 2. Frame assembly 20 Original Prusa MK4S kit assembly STEP 3 YZ frame: mounting the longer extrusions Take the LONGER extrusions and place them next to the frame. Make sure the engraved PRUSA logo (top left) on the frame is visible. This is the front side. The longer extrusions are going to be mounted to the front side.

Note: screws are inserted from the opposite side of the frame. If you need to manipulate with the frame, make sure the extrusions are on the correct side once again. Ensure you are using the correct holes closer to the center of the frame, see the second picture. Use the M5 screws to connect extrusions to the frame. Tighten the screws with the 3mm Allen key just slightly! Now, tighten the screws fully, but IN A DIAGONAL PATTERN, see the last picture. As soon as you finish tightening the first diagonal pair, tighten the second pair.

Then proceed to the other long extrusion. Be cautious when tightening these screws to avoid damaging the Allen key slot. Ensure the Allen key is fully inserted into the screw head. Tighten the screw firmly but gently. 2. Frame assembly Original Prusa MK4S kit assembly 21 STEP 4 YZ frame: mounting the shorter extrusions Take the SHORTER extrusions and place them next to the frame. Short extrusions must be placed on the side with the hexagonal recesses. Note: screws are inserted from the opposite side of the frame. If you need to

manipulate with the frame, make sure the extrusions are on the correct side. Ensure you are using the correct holes, see the second picture. Use the M5x16r screws to connect extrusions to the frame. Tighten the screws just slightly! Now, tighten the screws fully, but IN A DIAGONAL PATTERN, see the last picture. As soon as you finish the first diagonal pair, tighten the other screws. Then proceed to the last short extrusion. Be cautious when tightening these screws to avoid damaging the Allen key

slot. Ensure the Allen key is fully inserted into the screw head. Tighten the screw firmly but gently. STEP 5 YZ frame: final check Before we proceed further, let's make a final check. IT IS VERY IMPORTANT to have extrusions on the correct side of the frame. Long extrusions - must be mounted to the side of the frame with the Prusa logo. Also ensure longer extrusions are closer together. Short extrusions - must be on the other side of the frame without the Prusa logo. Also ensure shorter extrusions are further away from

each other. 2. Frame assembly 22 Original Prusa MK4S kit assembly STEP 6 Y-axis: front and rear plate preparation For the following steps, please prepare: Front plate (1x) Rear plate (1x) There is a silver label with serial number on the rear plate. Keep it in mind, we use it as a guide to orient the part later on. Do not remove the label! M5x16r screw (16x) M3nEs nuts (4x) STEP 7 Y-axis: front plate assembly Rotate the frame so the longer extrusions are facing towards you. Place the front plate (the shorter one) onto the extrusions and secure it with M5x16r

screws, DON'T TIGHTEN them yet! Now, tighten the screws fully, but IN A DIAGONAL PATTERN, see the second picture. As soon as you finish the first diagonal pair, tighten the second pair. Then proceed to the other long extrusion. Be cautious when tightening these screws to avoid damaging the Allen key slot. Ensure the Allen key is fully inserted into the screw head. Tighten the screw firmly but gently. 2. Frame assembly Original Prusa MK4S kit assembly 23 STEP 8 Y-axis: rear plate assembly Turn the printer so that the shorter extrusions are facing you.

Place the rear plate onto the extrusions and secure it with M5x16r screws, DON'T TIGHTEN them yet! Orient the part so that the sticker is on the back of the printer. Now, tighten the screws fully, but IN A DIAGONAL PATTERN, see the second picture. As soon as you finish the first diagonal pair, tighten the second pair. Then proceed to the other extrusion. Be cautious when tightening these screws to avoid damaging the Allen key slot. Ensure the Allen key is fully inserted into the screw head. Tighten the

screw firmly but gently. STEP 9 Y-axis: preparation for the xBuddy box Insert the M3nEs nut into the right short extrusion. Insert the side with the spring (metal plate) first. Orient the nut with the metal spring facing down. Push the entire nut inside the extrusion using your finger. Use this method for both M3nEs nuts. The exact position of the nuts doesn't matter at this time. 2. Frame assembly 24 Original Prusa MK4S kit assembly STEP 10 Y-axis: preparation for the PSU Turn the printer with the second

short extrusion facing you. Following the same procedure as in the previous step, insert two M3nEs nuts into the short extrusion profile. The exact position of the nuts doesn't matter at this time. STEP 11 Y-axis: geometry check Before you proceed any further, please make sure the frame is standing on a FLAT SURFACE. The frame screw openings are drilled by a high-precision CNC machine. Uneven tightening during can slightly warp the frame assembly. It can be corrected though. Using your hand, try to wiggle the frame side to side to check whether some of the

corners are lifting up. In case you find any imperfections, release the screws, press the extrusions against the FLAT SURFACE and tighten them again. Then check if the frame still rocks side to side, back and forth. Rotate the whole assembly 90 degrees and check again. Repeat the whole process if necessary. If any of the corners isn’t lifting more than 2mm (0.08 inch) high, proceed to the next step. 2. Frame assembly Original Prusa MK4S kit assembly 25 STEP 12 Mounting antivibration feet and cable clips: parts preparation

For the following steps, please prepare: Antivibration foot (4x) Cable clip (6x) STEP 13 Mounting antivibration feet Turn the whole frame assembly onto the side and insert an antivibration foot into the bottom groove of the each extrusion. Insert and turn 90 degrees to lock it in place. Repeat this process for all 4 feet. Place them 1-2 cm far from the end of each extrusion. 2. Frame assembly 26 Original Prusa MK4S kit assembly STEP 14 Installing the cable clip Turn the frame like in the picture and focus on the marked area

Take one of the cable clips and hook the side with the clip into the inner groove of the lower longer extrusion. There is a hook on the part, see the detail. Place the other end of the clip on the underside of the extrusion. Use more force to push on the bottom side of the cable clip. It must fit into the groove and you must feel it "click" in. STEP 15 Installing the cable clips Install three clips to the long extrusion. Install one clip to the short extrusion. Turn the frame, install two clips to the second short extrusion.

2. Frame assembly Original Prusa MK4S kit assembly 27 STEP 16 PSU: parts preparation For the following steps, please prepare: Delta PSU 240 W 24 V (1x) M3x10 screw (2x) M4x10r screw with dome head (2x) The PSU (Power Supply Unit) is designed to work worldwide and automatically adapt to the local voltage. STEP 17 Attaching the PSU Have a look at the right side of the frame and locate the M3nE nuts. Insert M3x10 screws into them. Turn them only 3-4 times by using a 2.5mm Allen key, just for the screws to be kept in place.

Take the PSU and place it above the screws. Adjust the M3nE nuts so they line up with the grooves on the bottom of the PSU's case. Slide the PSU down onto the screws. Screw them in some more, but don't tighten them firmly yet - we need the PSU to be able to move slightly so we can adjust its position in the next step! The screws should be able to hold the PSU in a "vertical" position for now. 2. Frame assembly 28 Original Prusa MK4S kit assembly STEP 18 Securing the PSU Now have a look at the frame from the front side. Verify the PSU is on the right

back side of the frame when looking from the front. Insert M4x10r screws into the holes in the frame, towards the front of the PSU. Adjust the position of the PSU, there are holes in the PSU's case, which must align with the holes in the frame. By default the PSU sits slightly lower than needed, pull it up little bit. until the M4 screws are able to catch the thread in the PSU. Make sure the PSU is pressed against both the frame and the extrusion on the bottom. Everything aligned? Tighten the M4 screws up using the same 2.5mm Allen key.

Now, tighten up the M3 screws on the bottom. 2. Frame assembly Original Prusa MK4S kit assembly 29 STEP 19 xBuddy box: parts preparation For the following steps, please prepare: xBuddy box (1x) xBuddy box is located in the box with plastic parts. Thermal pad 40x12x2.2 mm (1x) Thermal pad 12x12x2.2 mm (2x) M3x6 screw (9x) M3x10 screw (2x) The list continues in the next step... STEP 20 Mounting the xBuddy box: parts preparation For the following steps, please prepare: xBuddy board (1x) Always touch the sides of the electronics board while manipulating it. Avoid

touching the chips, capacitors and other parts of the electronics. Zip tie (4x) X-holder (1x) 2. Frame assembly 30 Original Prusa MK4S kit assembly STEP 21 Mounting the xBuddy box: inserting screws Insert four M3x6 screws to the back of the frame (side with shorter extrusions), so they resemble a rectangular pattern. Tighten the screws fully into the frame to clean the threads. Then loosen the screws, leaving a gap of at least 3 mm between the screw head and the frame. Make sure you are using the correct holes.

Insert two M3x10 screws into the M3nE nuts in the second short extrusion. Turn them only 3-4 times by using a 2.5mm Allen key, just for the screws to be kept in place. STEP 22 Attaching the xBuddy box Attach the xBuddy box on the M3x10 screws in the extrusion. Do not tighten the screws at the moment! Slide the xBuddy box to the frame and attach the box to all 4 screws in the frame. The screws must fit into the top part of the "key" hole. See the detail. 2. Frame assembly Original Prusa MK4S kit assembly

31 STEP 23 Securing the xBuddy box Fully tighten all four M3x6 screws to secure the xBuddy box. Be careful when tightening the "rear" top screw. Use the shorter side of the Allen key for final tightening. Fully tighten both M3x10 screws in the M3nE nuts. STEP 24 Applying the thermal pads Peel off the white protective layer from all thermal pads. Always touch the sides of the electronics board while manipulating it. Avoid touching the chips, capacitors and other parts of the electronics. Attach the pads onto the back of the xBuddy board. There are markings that

indicate the correct size and positions. The surface to which the pads are sticked must be cleaned of grease. This will ensure better adhesion. For the protection of the board's electronic components, we strongly recommend placing the xBuddy board on the soft pad. You can use the original xBuddy bubble wrap package. Peel off the blue protective layer from all thermal pads. 2. Frame assembly 32 Original Prusa MK4S kit assembly STEP 25 Mounting the xBuddy board For better access to the xBuddy box, carefully place the frame on the side with the

PSU. Insert the xBuddy board into the xBuddy box. Before fully attaching it completely, center the holes in the board with the holes (columns) in the xBuddy box Make sure the Ethernet connector is properly inserted into the hole in the xBuddy box. Fix the position of the xBuddy board by inserting five M3x6 screws. Do not fully tighten the screws. A few turns are enough for now. Put aside your instinct and leave the hole on the bottom right empty. Fully tighten all five screws. But very carefully, otherwise you can damage the

electronics board. 2. Frame assembly Original Prusa MK4S kit assembly 33 STEP 26 Attaching the zip ties Take a closer look at to the xBuddy box. There are four perforations on the metal case. You can place the frame on the PSU side for better access to the xBuddy box. Proceed very carefully. Be careful not to damage the connectors or capacitors on the xBuddy board. Use the X-holder as a zip tie guidance. Place the X-holder behind the lowest perforation like in the picture. Push the zip tie through the protrusion to the X-

holder. Keep protruding 3 - 5 cm of the zip tie from the perforation. Note the correct orientation of the zip tie. The teeth on the zip tie must be on the visible side. Use this procedure for all four protrusions. Do not discard the X-holder. You will need it later again. Place the printer back on its "feet". STEP 27 Y-belt-idler: parts preparation For the following steps, please prepare: Y-belt-idler (1x) M3x10 screw (2x) M3nS nut (2x) 2. Frame assembly 34 Original Prusa MK4S kit assembly STEP 28 Assembling Y-belt-idler

Insert two M3nS nuts into the Y-belt-idler. There is a groove in the hole for pushing the nut all the way in with an Allen key. STEP 29 Mounting the Y-belt-idler Arrange the frame so that the longer extrusions are facing you. Attach the Y-belt-idler from "inside" to the front plate. Note the correct orientation of the part.

STEP 31 Assembling the Y motor For the following steps, please prepare: Y motor (1x) Ensure you are using the correct motor, there is a label on the bottom of the casing. The reason is, each motor has different cable length. GT2-16 pulley (1x) 2. Frame assembly 36 Original Prusa MK4S kit assembly STEP 32 Assembling the Y-motor-holder Insert the M3nS nut into the corresponding openings on the top side of the Y-

motor-holder. Using the Allen key, push the nut all the way in. Some older versions of the part may be slightly different visually. However, this does not affect the procedure. Insert the M3nS nut all the way into the part from the side. Place the Y motor like in the picture. Use the motor cable as a guide. Attach the Y-motor-holder onto the Y motor and join both parts together with three M3x18 screws. STEP 33 Adjusting the Y-motor pulley There is a flat part on the motor shaft. Rotate the shaft, so the flat part is facing you

through the opening in the Y-motor-holder. Attach the pulley on the shaft and ensure that one of the grub screws is facing the flat part of the shaft. Do not tighten the grub screw yet. Note the CORRECT ORIENTATION of the pulley. Put one of the Allen keys on the MOST TOP surface of the printed part, like in the picture. And align the pulley with the Allen key. When the pulley is aligned, tighten the grub screw in the pulley against the flat part of the shaft. Then rotate the pulley and tighten the second grub screw.

2. Frame assembly Original Prusa MK4S kit assembly 37 STEP 34 Attaching the Y-motor-holder Peel off the white protective film from the thermal pad 25x25x1.2 mm. The side with the white film is more adhesive. If you have a thermal pad with a blue protective film on both sides, the side doesn't matter. Stick the thermal pad on the Y motor and peel off the second protective layer from it. The surface to which the pad is stuck must be cleaned of grease. This will ensure better adhesion. Place the Y-motor-holder onto the inner side of the rear plate of the frame.

Ensure the correct orientation. The pulley must be facing towards the PSU. Attach the Y-motor-holder by using two M3x10 screws. To keep the Y motor cable safe during the assembly, temporarily hide it in the extrusion on the xBuddy box side. 2.

Did you know that the original gummy bears were inspired by the dancing bears of Europe, and Riegel named them "Gummibärchen,"

which means "little rubber bears" in German. STEP 33 It's done! Compare your assembly with the picture. Everything is OK? Nice job, you just successfully assembled the X-axis assembly. Let's go the next chapter: 4. Z-axis assembly Original Prusa MK4S kit assembly 57 4. Z-axis assembly 4. Z-axis assembly 58 Original Prusa MK4S kit assembly STEP 1 Tools necessary for this chapter For this chapter, please prepare: 2.5mm Allen key Needle-nose pliers STEP 2 Assembling the Z-bottoms: parts preparation

For the following steps, please prepare: Z-bottom left (1x) Z-bottom right (1x) M3x10 screw (6x) Smooth rod 10 x 325 mm (2x) 4. Z-axis assembly Original Prusa MK4S kit assembly 59 STEP 3 Inserting the rods Using a paper towel, clean the smoothing rods of the preservative oil. The smooth rods must be perfectly smooth. Insert each 10mm smooth rod into the Z-bottom. Place in a screw-like motion for easier insertion of the rod. Tip: If the movement is still stiff, apply a small amount of Prusa lubricant, which

is included in your package, to the end of the rod. Through the inspection hole in both Z-bottoms, check if the rod is completely inserted. There must be NO gap between the smooth rod and the bottom of the hole. STEP 4 Assembling the Z-bottoms WARNING: Printed parts aren't the same! There are left and right pieces. See the protrusion (tooth) on each part. For the right side of the frame, there is a protrusion on the right side of the plastic part and vice versa. Attach both Z-bottoms to the frame and secure each part with three M3x10 screws.

Tip: you can turn the printer on its back side for better access to the Z-bottom installation. It is recommended to place a cardboard pad under the printer to protect your workbench and the printer against scratches. In case of increased resistance during tightening, try to run the screws through the threaded hole first without the printed part. Then remove the screws and attach the printed part. Avoid wobbling with the rods in the Z-bottoms, this could cause them to break and fatally destroy the plastic parts, which could lead to injury.

4. Z-axis assembly 60 Original Prusa MK4S kit assembly STEP 5 Z motor assembling: parts preparation For the following step, please prepare: Z motor left (labeled Z-axis left, shorter cable) Z motor right (labeled Z-axis right, longer cable) M3x10 screw (8x) Rubber pad 42x42x2 mm (2x) To avoid accidentally discarding parts, prepare the trapezoid nuts from the motor box and keep them in a safe place. You will need them in a few steps. STEP 6 Attaching the rubber pads Place both rubber pads onto the

motor surface. Make sure the holes in the pads are aligned with the holes in the motors. 4. Z-axis assembly Original Prusa MK4S kit assembly 61 STEP 7 Installing the Z motors Place the Z motor left (short cable) next to the left Z-bottom. Place the Z motor right (long cable) next to the right Z-bottom. The motor cables must guide under the frame to the PSU (right) and xBuddy Box (left). Push each motor through the Z-bottom and secure it with four M3x10 screws. Do not tighten them completely at the moment.

STEP 8 Connecting the Z motors Guide both the Z motor cables under the frame towards the xBuddy Box. Connect the cables to the third and fourth slots on top of the xBuddy Board. Motor cable labeled ZL connect into the left slot, ZR into the right. 4. Z-axis assembly 62 Original Prusa MK4S kit assembly STEP 9 Mounting the X-axis assembly: parts preparation For the following steps, please prepare: Trapezoidal nut (2x) The trapezoidal nuts are included in the Motor kit box. M3x10 screw (4x) X-holder (1x)

STEP 10 Assembling the X-axis and smooth rods Carefully slide the X-axis assembly onto the Z-axis smooth rods. Secure the position of the X-axis to the frame. Engage the X-holder IN THE CENTER of the X-axis by the top smooth rod and then by the printer frame. It is important to place the X-holder at the center of the frame and the X-axis. If not, the centering results could be inaccurate. 4. Z-axis assembly Original Prusa MK4S kit assembly 63 STEP 11 Installing the X-axis assembly Centering the threaded rods of the Z motors is important. However, it doesn't have

to be perfect. See the following instructions for more: Start with the right Z motor. By carefully and gradually tightening the individual screws holding the Z motor, align the threaded rod in the X-end-idler. Watch the threaded rod move while tightening. Tightening the right front screw tilts the top of the rod to the rear left - and vice versa. Tighten all screws firmly. Take a look at the threaded rod from the top. The threaded rods should be close to the center of the X-end-idler hole as much as possible. The threaded rod

shouldn't touch the surface of the printed part. See the third picture. PROCEED THE SAME WITH THE LEFT Z MOTOR. STEP 12 Assembling the trapezoidal nuts Screw the trapezoidal nut onto the right threaded rod. Note the correct orientation of the nut. The smaller diameter of the nut must fit into the hole in the X-end. If it does not, the threaded rod is incorrectly centered. Secure the trapezoidal nut with two M3x10 screws. It does not matter which holes in the nut you use. There may be a small gap between the trapezoidal nut and the printed part.

Tightening the two screws will cling the nut completely to the part. In the same way, install the second trapezoidal nut on the X-end-motor (left threaded rod). 4. Z-axis assembly 64 Original Prusa MK4S kit assembly STEP 13 Installing the Z-top parts: parts preparation For the following steps, please prepare: Z-top-left (1x) Z-top-right (1x) M3x10 screw (4x) STEP 14 Placing the Z-top parts Place the Z-top-left on the rods and align it with the frame, and align the holes in the plastic parts with the holes in the frame.

Use two M3x10 screws to attach the Z-top-left. Don't use excessive force during tightening. In case of increased resistance, try to run the screws in from the other side of the frame first to "clean up" the threaded hole. Then return to the front side. Tip: move the X-axis a few centimeters down for make some space if you can't reach the screw behind the rod. Repeat this step on the other side of the frame with Z-top-right printed part. Rotate both threaded rods in parallel to move the X-axis assembly a few

centimeters higher to release the X-holder. Remove the X-holder from the printer. 4. Z-axis assembly Original Prusa MK4S kit assembly 65 STEP 15 LoveBoard: parts preparation For the following steps, please prepare: LoveBoard (1x) included in the ELECTRONICS BOX Extruder main cable (1x) M3x6 screw (1x) STEP 16 Assembling the LoveBoard Move the X-axis assembly to the center of the Z-axis height. Do not push on the X-axis assembly! Turn the threaded rods to move the axis. Move the X-carriage approximately to the center of the X-axis.

Take the end of the extruder main cable without the white label. From the back of the printer, guide the extruder main cable to the front of the printer through the gap between the belt and the upper rod. 4. Z-axis assembly 66 Original Prusa MK4S kit assembly STEP 17 Connecting the extruder main cable Divide the twisted wires and straight cables from each other. First, guide the straight cables through the channel in the X-carriage. Then guide the twisted cables through the channel. Connect the extruder main cable to the LoveBoard. Leave the extruder main cable

extended approximately 2 centimeters (0.8 inches). STEP 18 Mounting the extruder main cable Attach the LoveBoard to the back of the X-carriage and secure it with the M3x6 screw. Very gently pull on the extruder main cable bundle to reduce the bundle on the connector side. There must be a minimal loop. Otherwise, the cable will interfere with other parts in the next chapter. The cables must not interfere with the extruder motor compartment. 4. Z-axis assembly Original Prusa MK4S kit assembly 67 STEP 19 Connecting the extruder main cable: parts preparation

Insert one of the bent ends of the nylon filament into the hole located on the left side of the extruder main cable channel in the X-carriage. The nylon filament must CURVE UPWARDS. Not down, not to sides. See the

detail. After the nylon filament holds in the X-carriage, check that it inclines upwards as seen in the picture. If it is pointing down instead, re-install the nylon filament into the X-carriage by the other bent end and check again. 4. Z-axis assembly Original Prusa MK4S kit assembly 69 STEP 23 Attaching the X-cover-back Before we cover the back of the X-carriage, make sure that: the upper bearing is in the pocket inside the X-carriage and the marking is facing you the nylon filament is pointing upwards

Align all bundle cables into the X-carriage-cable-holder guide channel. Place the X-carriage-back on the X-carriage and arrange the main cable wires like in the picture. Be careful, no wire must be pinched! Secure the X-carriage-back with two M3x18 screws. Insert and tighten the M3x10 screw into the upper hole in the X-carriage-back. STEP 24 Guiding the main-cable: parts preparation For the following steps, please prepare: Textile sleeve 8x520 (1x) There are three different textile sleeve sizes in your kit package. You can always

make sure by comparing their lengths. The ends of the textile sleeves are heat-sealed at the factory to prevent ripping. To open them, the sealed end joints must be cut or torn. Zip tie (2x) X-carriage-cable-holder-cover (1x) 4. Z-axis assembly 70 Original Prusa MK4S kit assembly STEP 25 Wrapping the extruder main cable Push two zip ties through the X-carriage-cable-holder. See the correct orientation of the zip ties. Wrap the extruder main cable and the nylon filament near the X-carriage with the

textile sleeve. Keep a 1 cm (0.39 inches) gap between the sleeve and the X-carriage. Wrap just this part near the joint, for now, we will continue wrapping the bundle in the next step. Cover it with X-carriage-cable-holder-cover. Tighten both zip ties so that the "heads" fit into the pockets in the plastic part. Cut off the excess zip tie. It is important that the heads of the zip ties are seated in the pockets. Otherwise, they may collide with the printer frame during X-axis calibration and the calibration could fail.

STEP 26 Wrapping the textile sleeve Wrap the textile sleeve around the extruder main cable and nylon filament. Proceed in a spiral motion around the bundle so that it is tightly bound together. Hold the cable bundle upwards while wrapping and continue until it is fully wrapped. 4.

From the same side, push the tubular spacer into the assembly. The "bottom" of the tubular spacer must be flush with the bottom part of the Idler assembly. STEP 4 Assembling the extruder: parts preparation I. For the following steps, please prepare: PG-assembly (1x) Note: There are two types of planetary gear assemblies shipped. Both are functionally

identical, so assembly remains the same. The latest version has several holes around the main gear. Heatsink assembly (1x) Main-plate (1x) PG-ring (1x) PG-assembly-adapter (1x) The list continues in the next step... 5. Nextruder assembly 78 Original Prusa MK4S kit assembly STEP 5 Assembling the extruder: parts preparation II. Extruder motor (1x) Spacer 5x10x0.1 mm (1x) Socket set screw M3x25 (1x) STEP 6 Assembling the extruder Place the 5x10x0.1 spacer over the shaft on the extruder motor. Place the heatsink on the extruder motor. Note the orientation of both parts.

The motor cable must be facing "up". The heatsink cables must be on the right side. Place the main-plate on the heatsink. Note the orientation of the part. Use the cutout as a guide. Before proceeding to the next step, make sure that the 5x10x0.1 spacer is placed on the extruder motor. 5. Nextruder assembly Original Prusa MK4S kit assembly 79 STEP 7 Assembling the gearbox The following instructions need to be done correctly and carefully. Achieve better understanding and successful assembly by watching the video alongside the guide:

prusa.io/PG-assembly After watching the video, follow the steps in this guide. Attach the PG-assembly-adapter on the PG-assembly. Note the pockets for the gears in the adapter. STEP 8 Assembling the PG-ring Do not assemble the gearbox without the PG-assembly-adapter. This tool is intended to ensure that the gears are correctly fit together. Slide the PG-ring onto the adapter. Note there is a chamfer on one side of the PG-ring teeth. This side must be facing down (to the PG-assembly). Grasp the entire assembly in one hand so that it can be rotated with the PG-ring.

With the other hand, slide the PG-ring onto the PG assembly in a wobbling motion (move the PG-ring left and right repeatedly) - a quarter turn is enough. Stop when the surfaces of the gears are approximately flush with the surface of the PG ring. 5. Nextruder assembly 80 Original Prusa MK4S kit assembly STEP 9 Assembling the PG-assembly Proceed very carefully in this step. Maintain the position of the PG-assembly and attach it on to extruder motor shaft. Very gently and freely rotate with the whole PG assembly (PG-assembly-adapter,

PG-assembly and PG-ring) until it drops down so that there is no gap between the assembly and the main-plate. Do not push on the assembly. Remove the PG-assembly-adapter. STEP 10 Checking the PG-assembly Attach the PG-assembly-adapter back on the PG-assembly again to verify that all parts are properly seated. Rotate with the PG-assembly-adapter. The PG assembly must be easy to rotate without having to exert much force. Remove the PG-adapter. You will no longer need it during assembly. We recommend keeping it for maintenance.

Ensure that the PG-assembly is not sticking out above the PG-ring. It should be positioned lower than the level of the PG-ring's surface or at the same level as the ring. Ensure that the gap between the PG-ring and the Main-plate is minimal. If a significant gap is observed, disassemble the planetary gear assembly and reposition it. 5. Nextruder assembly Original Prusa MK4S kit assembly 81 STEP 11 Assembling the Nextruder idler Insert the idler assembly between the PG-ring and the extruder motor. There is a

cutout for the spacer in the main-plate. Line up the idler spacer with the hole in the PG-ring. Secure both parts with the socket set screw 3x25. Do not overtighten the screw! The screw protrudes from the PG-ring after tightening.

Connect the filament sensor cable to the lower slot on the right side of the LoveBoard.

5. Nextruder assembly Original Prusa MK4S kit assembly 95 STEP 39 LoveBoard: Wiring check Before covering the electronics, check the connection of all cables. Click on high- resolution preview in the top left corner. Close the idler mechanism before proceeding to the next step if you haven't already done so. Use the following sequence: Close the extruder idler to the extruder Close the idler-swivel and lock it over the extruder idler assembly STEP 40 Covering the LoveBoard: parts preparation For the following steps, please

prepare: LoveBoard-cover (1x) LoveBoard-cover-right (1x) M3x10 screw (1x) 5. Nextruder assembly 96 Original Prusa MK4S kit assembly STEP 41 Covering the LoveBoard: side cover Curve and arrange the cables on the right side of the extruder as you can see in the picture. Cover the cables with the LoveBoard-cover-right. Do not pinch the cables! Secure it with the M3x10 screw. Make sure the LoveBoard-cover-right fits snugly against the right side of the extruder. If not, it may cause the X-axis test to fail during the self-test because it

will prevent the X-carriage assembly from moving all the way to the right. STEP 42 Covering the LoveBoard: top cover Push all cables to the extruder to make more space around them. See the picture. Slide the Loveboard-cover on the extruder. And push it all the way down. The cover must go behind the X-carriage-back. Be careful not to pinch any cables. Ensure that the two plastic covers fit together perfectly. 5. Nextruder assembly Original Prusa MK4S kit assembly 97 STEP 43 Tensioning the X-axis belt

In this step, we will finish tensioning the belt. Please read the instructions first, your belt might have proper tension already, then there is no need for additional screw adjustment. First, slightly release all the screws holding the motor, otherwise, the "tensioner" won't work (the motor must be able to move). Using ball-end Allen key start tightening the screw on the rear side of the X-end- motor, but after each turn or two check the tension in the belt. For optimal performance, the belt must have some resistance when pressed with

your fingers.  Move the extruder to the X-end-idler and try the belt tension in the middle of the X-axis. When you achieve optimal tension, please tighten the screws again. 5. Nextruder assembly 98 Original Prusa MK4S kit assembly STEP 44 Belt tension check This step is recommended, but optional. If you don't have a phone at your disposal, continue to the next step. You can do this check later on. To verify or fine-tune the X or Y-axis belt tension on your printer, visit prusa.io/belt- tuner and open up the webpage on your mobile device. Or using your phone, scan

the QR code in the picture. Watch the instructional video on prusa.io/belt-tuner-video and fine-tune your X belt tension, if required. The belt tuner app was tested on multiple phones and should work across all most common phone manufacturers. However, in some rare cases it might not work as expected. Please state your brand and model in the comments below the step. STEP 45 Testing the X-axis belt Use the technique described below to test if the belt is properly stretched. Grasp and hold the flat part of the X

motor shaft with pliers. This will prevent it from rotating in the pliers. Move the extruder towards the X motor. Don't use excessive force. If the belt is stretched properly, you should feel a resistance and the extruder won't move at all. If the belt is too loose, it will deform (create a "wave") and jump over the teeth on the pulley. 5. Nextruder assembly Original Prusa MK4S kit assembly 99 STEP 46 Haribo time! Eat five gummy bears. Did you know that gummy bears have a long shelf life, typically

lasting for up to two years if stored properly in a cool and dry place. But don't do that now. STEP 47 The extruder is assembled That was tough. But we made it! Let's go the next chapter: 6. xLCD assembly 100 Original Prusa MK4S kit assembly 6. xLCD assembly 6. xLCD assembly Original Prusa MK4S kit assembly 101 STEP 1 Tools necessary for this chapter For the following steps, please prepare: 2.5mm Allen key Needle-nose pliers for tightening and cutting zip ties Torx key T8/10 Phillips screwdriver

Position the xReflector sticker strip so that it lines up with one side and both the edges of the "gutter" in the xLCD-cover. Continue to lay down the xReflector sticker strip towards the other side of the gutter. Press the xReflector sticker strip all the way into the gutter so it adheres to the xlcd- cover. 6. xLCD assembly Original Prusa MK4S kit assembly 103 STEP 5 Covering the xLCD Carefully slide the xLCD into the xLCD-support, ensuring it snaps under the plastic

tabs. Align the screw holes in the xLCD board with the holes in the plastic part. Place the xLCD-cover on the xLCD, orienting it so the encoder passes through the hole in the cover. STEP 6 Installing the PE/FE Faston From the back of the xLCD assembly, secure all parts together using three 3x8sT. The screws cut thread directly into the plastic, so there might be some resistance. Through the opening in the xLCD-support, place the PE/FE Faston on the xLCD with the exact orientation as shown. Center the PE/FE Faston in the opening and secure it with the 3x8sT screw.

The screw cuts thread directly into the plastic, so there might be some resistance. 6. xLCD assembly 104 Original Prusa MK4S kit assembly STEP 7 xLCD cables: parts preparation For the following steps, please prepare: xLCD cable (1x) xLCD-knob(1x) FE cable 460/420 mm (1x) Since late 2024, kits may include a black cable instead of a yellow-green. This change does not affect the assembly. Note: The images in the following steps show the yellow-green version of the PE cable. The procedure is identical for both color variations.

3x12sT screw (4x) STEP 8 Connecting the xLCD cable & FE cable Take the xLCD cable and prepare the end without the QR code label. If your xLCD cable doesn't have a label, it won't affect functionality. The choice of cable end is purely for aesthetics. Connect the xLCD cable to the xLCD board. Ensure the safety latch on the cable connector aligns with the triangle symbol on the xLCD slot. Make sure the xLCD cable is connected in the same orientation as seen in the picture. Otherwise, your display won't work

STEP 10 Attaching the xLCD assembly There are four holes in the front plate of the printer's frame. Insert four 3x12sT

screws through each of them from the inner side. Attach the xLCD assembly onto the front plate. The screws should fit into the corresponding openings in the xLCD assembly. Guide the xLCD and FE cables under the front plate to the frame. Tighten up all four 3x12sT screws. The screw cuts thread directly into the plastic, so there might be some resistance. If screws are hard to tighten, pre-screw them into the xLCD support to create a thread for easier tightening. Guide both cables through the cable clips inside the frame, leaving the end of the

xLCD cable free for now. 6. xLCD assembly 106 Original Prusa MK4S kit assembly STEP 11 Connecting the PSU: parts preparation For the following steps, please prepare: PSU-cover (1x) M3x10 screw (2x) xBuddy power cable (2x) Power panic cable (1x) Zip tie (4x) STEP 12 Connecting the PSU: FE cable Place the printer so that you have easy access to the bottom side of the PSU. Remove the left screw on the PSU circuit board. Note there is a washer on the screw.  Do not throw the screw away, you will need it later.

Place the single end of the FE (not the forked end) cable into the same place you have removed the screw. Secure the cable by re-using the screw together with the washer. Note the correct orientation of the FE cable connector. Guide the FE cable so that it does not interfere with the threaded column under the PE/FE connector. 6. xLCD assembly Original Prusa MK4S kit assembly 107 STEP 13 Power cables info In the following steps, we will be connecting the power cables one by one. The terminal screws are installed on the PSU already. Loosen them but don't remove

them completely so they don't get mixed up with the other type of screws used on the xBuddy board side of the cable. Each of the two power cables has two leads. One has a prevailing red color = positive / + One has a prevailing black color = negative / - Note that the power cables have different connectors on each end. For now, prepare the U-shaped connectors (crimping tube color may vary). Note that the polarity of the terminals on the PSU is: Positive (V+) Positive (V+) Negative (V-) Negative (V-)

The red cable (positive) may have a black stripe on it. Similarly, the black cable (negative) can have a red stripe on it. Do not connect any cables yet, wait until you have been prompted. 6. xLCD assembly 108 Original Prusa MK4S kit assembly STEP 14 Connecting the PSU (part 1) Take two RED wires and slide the fork connectors all the way into the first two (positive) terminals from the left on the bottom of the PSU.

Start with the side with the one pocket. Attach the bearing clip on the cutout. Insert the bearing into the bearing clip. STEP 15 Aligning the bearing

The correct bearing orientation: When placing bearings onto the Y-carriage, make sure that they are oriented as shown in the picture. The tracks (rows of balls) have to be in the corners. Align the bearing so that it is centered in the bearing clip. Approximately the same amount of bearing should be visible on each side. Maintain the bearing position and slightly tighten both screws. Just enough to maintain the bearing’s position and orientation. You will tighten the screws firmly later on. 7. Y-carriage & Heatbed assembly

Original Prusa MK4S kit assembly 125 STEP 16 Installing the bearings on the Y-carriage Attach two bearing clips on the remaining two bearing pockets and push two bearings inside. Orient both bearings so that the two rows of bearing balls have to be on the sides. STEP 17 Positioning of the bearings Correct bearing alignment is CRUCIAL. Proceed carefully and make sure that both bearings are as close to the center of the Y-carriage as possible and do not touch any pocket edge. Unlike the previous single-bearing, position the bearings as close to the center of

the Y-carriage as possible. Beware, the bearings must not touch the edge of the pocket! Incorrect positioning: the bearings must not touch or overlap the edges of the pocket as shown in the bottom of the first picture. Maintain the bearing's position and slightly tighten the screws. Just barely to maintain the position and orientation of the bearings. We will tighten the screws firmly later on. After securing the clips double-check the correct position of the bearings so that they do not touch the edges of the pockets.

7.

NOW, PLEASE BE VERY CAREFUL! Gently insert the rod straight into the bearings, do not apply too much force and do not tilt the rod! In case you manage to push out some balls from the bearings by accident, please

count the balls. Without one or two balls, the bearing will continue to work. If there are more of them, please consider ordering new bearings. Tighten the screws on each bearing clip. After the final tightening, the movement of the smooth rods must be gentle. If the smooth rod moves stiffly, loosen the screws and repeat the procedure. After tightening all the screws securing the bearing clips, make a final check of the correct position of the bearings: Two-bearing side: the bearing must be positioned closer to the center of the Y-

carriage. It must not touch or extend over the edge of the pocket. Single-bearing side: the bearing must be in the center of the pocket. 7. Y-carriage & Heatbed assembly Original Prusa MK4S kit assembly 127 STEP 20 Preparing Y-rod-holder Take one Y-rod-holder and insert two M3nS nuts. Make sure you've pressed the nuts all the way in.

Preflight check 158 Original Prusa MK4S kit assembly STEP 13 Loading a filament Add a spool or a sample of your favourite filament onto either side of the spool holder. Guide the filament end through the filament guide into the extruder. Using the filament guide prevents filament tangling. Once a filament is detected, the printer will load it automatically. It is important to select the correct type of filament you are using on the screen. We recommend

using PLA material for the first test print. The printer will purge some of the material through the nozzle. Confirm its color is clear by selecting YES on the screen and remove the leftover plastic from below the nozzle. Proceed carefully, the nozzle is now very HOT! Do not touch it with your bare hands!

Research a.s. under the license of Prusa Development a.s. | Other company names and product names appearing in this publication are the trademarks and registered trademarks of their respective companies. About the author Josef Prusa (born Feb 23rd, 1990) became interested in the 3D printing phenomenon before joining Prague’s University of Economics in 2009 - at first, it was a hobby, a new technology open to changes and improvements. The hobby soon became a passion and Josef grew into one of the

leading developers of Adrien Bowyer’s international, open-source, RepRap project. Today, you can see the Prusa design in different versions all around the world, it is one of the most popular printers and thanks to it, knowledge about 3D printing technology significantly increased among the public. All 3D printers by Josef Prusa are open-source and based on the RepRap philosophy - you can use your 3D printer to produce parts for building another 3D printer. The lineup of Original Prusa devices is constantly expanded with new machines and upgrades.

The main goal is to make technology more accessible and understandable to all users. Josef Prusa also organizes workshops for the public, participates in professional conferences dedicated to the popularization of 3D printing. For example, he lectured at the TEDx conference in Prague and Vienna, at World Maker Faire in New York, Maker Faire in Rome and at the Open Hardware Summit hosted by MIT. Josef also teaches Arduino at Charles University and was also a lecturer at the Academy of Arts in Prague.

In his own words, he imagines 3D printers will be available in every home in the not-too-distant future. “If anything is needed, you can simply print it. In this field, you just push the boundaries every day… We're glad you're part of it with us!” Josef Průša Table of contents 1.

8 Placement and basic usage Make sure the printer is placed in a suitable location to prevent mechanical damage and potential safety risks. The device is for indoor use only. Do not expose the printer to rain and snow. Contact with water and water-based substance may lead to electrical failures, short circuits and other types of damage. Always keep the printer in a dry environment. Place the printer in a safe, dry and horizontally stable location - e.g. a workbench. There should be at least 30 cm (1 ft.) of space around the printer. Objects in near vicinity of the printer could

lead to an increased wear of the printer's cables, which could result in a safety hazard - worn cables may present an electrical and fire hazard. Make sure none of the vents and fans are blocked. The printer has built-in fan RPM monitoring, however, in certain cases (e.g. by installing an unofficial firmware) the monitoring may not work as intended. Insufficient cooling may lead to dangerous overheating, electrical and fire hazards, and damage to the printer. Make sure the printer is placed in a location, where it cannot fall or be tipped over. Using a

printer that has been damaged as a result of a fall may lead to safety risks. The power adapter and its cord should be placed in a location where one cannot trip over the cable, step on it or stumble over it. Make sure that the cable is not mechanically or otherwise damaged. If so, stop using the damaged power cord immediately and replace it. Damaged power cord may present a safety hazard - there's a danger of an electric shock. Do not leave the printer unattended while it's still on! While the device has a number of safety

features and temperature monitoring, issues such as (but not limited to) incorrect wiring, damaged cables, failure of components, and/or failure to follow the instructions in the official handbook and assembly manual may lead to a fire hazard. Electrical safety Please follow these instructions to avoid the risk of an electrical injury. The printer supply is a household power outlet - 230 VAC / 50 Hz or 110 VAC / 60 Hz. Never connect the printer to a different power supply; it may cause malfunction or damage to the

printer. Never use the printer when the power cords are damaged in any way. This includes the power cord, the power supply unit cable, and the wiring on the printer. There may be a risk of an electrical injury involved. To disconnect the power cord from the socket, pull the plug rather than the cord to reduce the risk of damage to the plug or to the AC outlet. Damaged plug may present a risk of an electrical injury. The plug that connects to the printer has a safety locking mechanism: first pull the cover of the plug to unlock it, then disconnect the plug from the printer.

Never disassemble the printer's power supply: it does not contain any parts that could be repaired by an unskilled worker. All repairs must be performed by a qualified technician. Tampering with the power supply may lead to damage to the printer and/or electrical hazards. The plug serves as a disconnecting element. The power outlet must be easily accessible. 9 Mechanical safety Moving mechanical parts of the printer may cause an injury. The printer has moving parts. Do not reach inside the printer while it is still in operation - you

may be risking an injury caused by the moving parts or electrical current. Prevent children from unsupervised access to the printer even when it is not printing. Risk of burns Do not touch heated elements - the heatbed/print sheet and parts of the print head to avoid severe burns! Caution! During operation, the heatbed and parts of the print head may get very hot! Do not touch them until the print is finished and the device cools down - temperatures are displayed on the LCD screen. Touching heated parts may lead to severe burns!

Proper usage of double-sided spring steel print sheets Every type of spring steel print sheet requires a different approach. Incorrect maintenance and usage may lead to damage to the print sheets and loss of warranty. Please read the following section carefully before using the sheets. Never clean the surface of the textured and satin sheets with acetone! Read maintenance instructions in Chapter 9 - Regular Maintenance Calibrate Live Z when you switch sheets - sheets have different thickness. New MINI firmware

versions have the option to save print sheet profiles for quicker switching (read Chapter 9 - Regular Maintenance to learn more) Use high-quality isopropyl alcohol only to clean (degrease) the sheet. Do not use products with isopropyl alcohol as one of the components (e.g. hand sanitizers) - these products have various additives, e.g. moisturizers, which can negatively affect the adhesion properties. Do not wash with running water to prevent the formation of rust. Do not peel off the PEI sticker from the surface

Wipe the sheet with IPA-infused tower before the first print Working with filaments Working with filaments is easy, clean and safe when handled properly. Here are some suggestions to keep in mind. Always use the correct temperatures for the selected material Be careful around melted plastic - it may cause burns. Do not remove excess filament from around the nozzle with your bare hand - use pliers or similar tool. Some materials may produce prominent odors - keep the room ventilated. Place the filament spool and prepare the filament for printing according to the instructions in

this handbook. 10 1. Introduction Thank you for purchasing the Original Prusa MINI+ 3D printer from Josef Prusa! Your purchase supports us in the further development of the MINI+ and other devices. Original Prusa MINI+ is our compact, smart and affordable 3D printer, which was designed as a 3D printing workhorse and a great starter printer. We hope you will enjoy using it! Please, read the handbook carefully, since all chapters contain valuable info regarding the operation of the equipment, getting-started instructions, 3D printing tips, and everything about regular

maintenance. Please check the prusa3d.com/drivers page for the updated version of this 3D printing handbook (PDF download). In case of any printer-related problem, do not hesitate to contact us at info@prusa3d.com. We are glad to receive your valuable comments and tips. You can also visit our knowledge base at help.prusa3d.com and forums at forum.prusa3d.com. 11 2. Glossary Spring steel sheet - comes in three variants: smooth, satin and textured. This is where the 1. printed object appears. Please read the maintenance instructions carefully to ensure optimal

conditions for 3D printing. Heatbed - located directly under the spring steel sheet. Heatbed ensures good adhesion of the 2. printed object. Warning: do not touch the heatbed when it’s hot! Y-Axis - the general name for the entire heatbed assembly (smooth rods, belt, heatbed…). 3. Knob and reset button - The knob is the main control device of the Original Prusa MINI+ 3D 4. printer: rotate left/right to scroll through options, press the knob to confirm your selection. There’s a reset switch directly next to the knob. Press it to perform a hard reset - e.g. if you

need to quickly stop and cancel a running print job. LCD screen - the display is used for the configuration of the 3D printer. Use the knob to scroll 5. through the menus and confirm your selection with the press of the knob. Power switch - when the printer is not in use, turn it off using the power switch. 6. USB port and microUSB port - USB port is compatible with USB 2.0/3.0 flash drives 7. (FAT32 filesystem). Use this port to insert a USB drive with print files (G-Codes) or firmware files for updating the firmware. The microUSB port can be used to run third-party solutions,

such as Octoprint (see https://octoprint.org for more details). Main PTFE tube - leads the filament strand from the extruder into the print head / nozzle. 8. Inspect it from time to time to make sure there is no debris inside that would prevent the filament strand from reaching the nozzle. 12 Tube fitting - on both ends of the main PTFE tube. In case filament gets stuck in the PTFE 9. tube, use a spanner (included with the printer) to remove the fittings and the PTFE tube to get access to the filament strand. Please note that PTFE tubes are consumables - their quality

may degrade over time. See the chapter about PTFE tubes for more information. Print fan - cools the printed object, improves print quality. Comes with RPM monitoring. 10. Print head - Lightweight print head consisting of the hotend (printing nozzle), SuperPINDA 11. probe and two fans. The heaviest parts of the extruder were moved onto the Z-axis tower to improve print quality. Nozzle - 0.4mm nozzle, can be replaced with e.g. 0.25mm or 0.6mm E3D-compatible nozzles 12. to achieve various effects. Z-Axis - the entire vertical axis assembly (smooth rods, Z-axis motor…).

13. Extruder / Extruder motor - as opposed to 3D printers like MK2 or MK3S, the extruder motor 14. is not moving along the X-axis. Instead, it’s fixed on the side and pushes filament through the PTFE tube towards the print head. X-Axis - allows the movement of the belt-driven print head from left to right. 15. Spool holder - should be placed near the printer, so the filament strand can enter the PTFE 16. tube from below. Filament must not bend at an acute angle. 3. Package contents - Accessories (bundled / optional)

Your Original Prusa MINI+ comes bundled with: • USB drive with firmware files • Allen key • Spanner • Surface cleaning wipes (infused with isopropyl alcohol) • Acupuncture needle These are the basic tools required for correct assembly and basic maintenance. However, we recommend getting some extra items to improve your 3D printing experience. Side cutting pliers - for filament cutting Isopropyl alcohol, paper wipes - for print sheet maintenance Metal spatula - for easier removal of prints stuck to the smooth steel sheet

13 4. Handling / Transporting the printer When transporting the Original Prusa MINI+, use the recommended way of holding the device. You can either grab it by the Z-axis motor at the top, or by the Z-Axis assembly. See photos below for reference. Never hold it by the cables or PTFE tubes, damage to the printer could occur! 4.1. Disconnecting the power supply The power supply plug that goes in your printer has a locking mechanism - do not pull it with force! Do not pull the cable! Incorrect manipulation may result in damage to the plug and/or

cable. First, unlock the mechanism by pulling the cover of the plug away from the printer. Once the mechanism is unlocked, you can pull the plug out of the printer. 14 4.2.

The information provided in the URL is stored in our database to help us better understand, which errors are the most common and how many errors each printer experienced. 4.4. Unpacking, assembly and first start The Original Prusa MINI+ 3D printer is available as a semi-assembled model, or as an assembly kit. The semi-assembled model consists of three large parts that need to be attached together. On the other hand, the assembly kit presents a unique opportunity to build your 3D printer literally

screw by screw by following an online guide at help.prusa3d.com. Please flip this handbook to get to the Assembly instructions and pre-flight check of the semi-assembled version. Then return here to continue with the setup process. If you’re viewing this handbook online, please head to help.prusa3d.com and open the online version of the assembly manual. Before you start using the device for the first time, consider checking www.prusa3d.com/drivers for the latest firmware version. 15 5. Your first print

Preparing the printer for the first print takes about 15-30 minutes (not including assembly). Please pay attention to the following steps to ensure the machine will operate as intended. In this chapter, you will learn how to: Control the printer 1. Update the firmware 2. Prepare the print surface for the first print 3. Perform the initial calibration 4. Load filament 5. Start the first print 6. 5.1. Basic controls You can configure and control the entire device with a single control element: a rotational knob

(1), which can be pressed to confirm the selection. The reset button (2) is placed to the left from the control knob. Pressing the reset button equates to quick toggle of the power switch. It is useful when the printer exhibits unexpected behavior, or you see a failed print that requires to be stopped immediately. 16 5.2. Updating the firmware The printer is shipped with latest firmware available at the time of manufacturing. However, we recommend to check www.prusa3d.com/drivers for the latest firmware version to

ensure optimal printing experience. To flash firmware downloaded from our website, please follow these steps: 1. Download the correct firmware file from www.prusa3d.com/drivers (ZIP archive) and unpack it 2. Place the .BBF file on a FAT32-formatted USB drive - you can use the one bundled with your MINI+ 3. Insert the USB drive into the printer’s USB port 4. Restart the device using the restart button next to the Knob 5. The update process should start automatically 6. Wait until the process is complete

To force the firmware flashing procedure (e.g. when you need to downgrade the firmware), insert a USB drive containing the desired .BBF file, restart the printer and press and hold the knob during the start-up. 17 5.3. Preparing flexible steel sheets Please follow the instructions for the sheet of your choice (see below) and prepare it for the first print. The heatbed has embedded high curie temperature magnets inside, which hold removable spring steel sheets in place. There are two pins at the end of the heatbed that will align perfectly with

cut out edges of the spring steel sheets. These pins aren’t meant to fit into the two holes on the other side of sheet! Make sure the bed is clean and there isn’t any debris on it before you put on the steel sheet. Never print directly on the heatbed. Unpack the IPA-infused cleaning wipe and clean the steel sheet before you start. Heatbed and powder-coated steel sheet surface To achieve the best adhesion of the printed object, it is important to keep the surface clean. Please see the information in the chapter 9 Regular Maintenance for more information about

print surface preparation, recommended cleaning products and warranty info. 5.4. Calibration Wizard Once the printer starts for the first time, the Wizard will show up. It will guide you through all the tests and calibrations you need to perform in order to start printing. The Wizard can be also started manually from LCD menu - Calibration - Wizard. Do not forget to read chapter 9.1 Flexible steel sheets before running the Wizard. The Calibration Wizard consists of Selftest, Mesh Bed Leveling and First Layer Calibration.

18 5.5. Selftest The Selftest is a diagnostic tool and consists of a series of tests. They are designed to reveal the most common issues, such as incorrect wiring. The progress and results of each step are displayed on the LCD. In case any issues are found, the selftest is interrupted and the cause of the error is shown to guide users in troubleshooting. IMPORTANT: It is required to have the steel sheet on the bed before performing the selftest, otherwise, the selftest will fail. The selftest consists of:

Extruder and print fan test X,Y, and Z-axis test Heatbed and hotend proper wiring If the selftest failed, please ensure that the steel sheet is placed correctly on the heatbed. 5.6. Loading and unloading the filament Once the Selftest is finished, you can load a strand of filament. We strongly suggest using PLA for the initial calibration and first print, because it's easier to use and does not require any extra steps (such as applying glue onto the steel sheet). If you don't have a spool of PLA, read

chapters 9 Material guide and 10 Regular maintenance carefully to learn how to prepare the steel sheet for specific materials. Every time you load a new filament, make sure the tip of the strand is sharp and there are no bumps or other unwanted shapes that would prevent the filament from entering the PTFE tube. Filament spools should be kept around the same level as the printer, so the filament strand can enter the PTFE tube without excessive bending. 19 Loading filament Cut the end of the filament strand to create a sharp tip. Insert the filament into the

1. extruder PTFE tube (right side of the device), or into the short PTFE tube of the filament sensor (optional accessory). Choose LCD Menu - Filament - Load filament and press the button to confirm. 2. The preheat menu will be automatically displayed. Select the type of filament you 3. wish to load and confirm the selection by pressing the control knob. Wait for the nozzle to reach the target preheat temperature. 4. Press the control knob to start loading and push the filament into the extruder until

5. the extruder drive gears grab the filament. The filament is then loaded into the print head by the extruder gears automatically. 6. The printer will ask you if the color of the extruded plastic is correct. You have three options: Yes/No/Retry. In case the plastic is contaminated with previous filament's color, choose “No” and the printer will push some more material out of the nozzle. Choosing Retry will repeat the loading process. This is useful e.g. in case when the filament strand stopped mid-way in the main PTFE tube.

The printer keeps track of the currently loaded filament, even when powered off. You can check the type of the currently loaded filament in the bottom right corner of the LCD Menu. For the next step, keep the filament loaded. If, for some reason, you need to change the filament before First Layer Calibration (or at any other time), follow these instructions: Unloading filament Choose LCD Menu - Filament - Unload filament. 1. The printer will automatically preheat to the correct temperature, the beeper will

2. notify you when the preheating finishes. Press the control knob to start unloading. 3. Once the extruder gears stop unloading the filament, pull the filament out from the 4. PTFE tube manually. 5.7. First Layer Calibration This process will calibrate the distance between the tip of the nozzle and the probe. You can launch the calibration at any time from LCD Menu - Calibration - First layer cal. Make sure the steel sheet is clean and there’s no grease on it, even fingerprints can cause an issue. Use the IPA-infused cleaning wipe that came with your printer to clean it before you

start. 20 Once you start the First Layer Calibration, the printer will ask you whether filament is loaded. Once it is, the printer will probe the bed using the Mesh Bed Leveling routine (see chapter 6.2 Mesh Bed Leveling for more information) and start printing a zig-zag pattern on the print surface. The nozzle will be at the height defined by the SuperPINDA probe setting. It must not by any means touch the printing surface. Starting with firmware 4.3.0, the nozzle height adjustment screen has a new design with a simplified depiction of the nozzle. As you

adjust the height of the nozzle by rotating the knob clockwise or anti-clockwise, the nozzle on the screen will follow the same movement direction. Please note that the number on the screen is for illustration purposes only. Your Z height will be different. Observe the line which is being extruded on the print surface. A new menu will automatically show up - use it to tune the nozzle height in real time by turning the knob. The aim is to adjust the nozzle height until the extruded plastic sticks nicely to the bed and you can see that it is being

slightly squished. Make sure the testing pattern looks like the one on the left or middle picture below. The picture on the right displays both serious issues: nozzle too high (bent lines, shifted corners) and nozzle too low (plastic not extruded) 21 What to check: The top of the extruded plastic is slightly squashed The corners of the zig-zag line are sharp and do not lift from the sheet The lines are straight and stay on the sheet firmly The ending box has an even surface, there are no waves or gaps

Below, you can see a close up of a print displaying quality issues caused by an incorrect nozzle height. The picture in the middle is the optimal quality. First layer height comparison - nozzle too high (left), optimal height (middle), nozzle too low (right) If you have the assembly kit version of the MINI+ and you have trouble reaching a consistent first layer, it might be caused by an incorrectly positioned SuperPINDA sensor. Please refer to the online assembly guide to see how the SuperPINDA probe should be positioned.

22 5.8. Checklist If you followed the steps described in the previous chapter, you are now ready to start your first print. Before you start, let’s go through the final checklist: MINI+ is fully assembled and placed in a suitable location 1. The firmware is updated to the latest version 2. All of the calibration procedures were successful 3. A clean print sheet cleaned with IPA-infused cleaning wipe is on the heatbed 4. Filament is loaded 5. 5.9. Starting the first print Once everything is ready, you can navigate to the PRINT menu (available only when a USB drive

is inserted). Use the knob to select a sample object from the list and observe the printer. We recommend choosing the PRUSA logo, because it gives you a great overview of how well you tweaked the first layer during First Layer Calibration. You should aim for this level of quality with your first layer The nozzle will preheat to 170 °C independently on the selected filament - this is to prevent oozing of the filament during the initial phase, which is Mesh Bed Leveling. Once MBL is done, the printer will preheat the nozzle to the correct printing temperature and start with the initial purging

line at the edge of the print bed. Then, it will start printing the skirt around the object and the object itself. Pay close attention to the quality of the first layer. Extruded plastic should stick to the sheet nicely. If, for some reason, the nozzle is too high, either try to lower it with the Live Adjust Z function (available through the Tune menu during an active print job), or stop the print completely, clean the sheet and re-run First Layer Calibration from the Calibration menu. 5.10. Removing the print

Once the print finishes, wait for the heatbed to cool down. Both the heatbed and the steel sheet may reach up to 100°C and cause burns if touched with naked skin. Depending on the material and steel sheet used, your print might automatically detach as the sheet cools down. If that’s not the case, lift the steel sheet and bend it both inwards and outwards carefully, rotate it 90 degrees and repeat the bending. Don’t forget to remove all leftover pieces of filament, such as the intro purge line, the skirt and the support base. If there is any leftover plastic on the sheet, do

not use your fingernails to remove it - this could potentially lead to an injury. Instead, use a metal spatula on the smooth sheet or a plastic spatula on the textured sheet. 23 Try to avoid touching the steel sheet surface with your fingers - fingerprints can decrease the adhesion of the next print. 5.11. After-print checks and actions Once the sample print is removed from the steel sheet, inspect it closely and check for possible issues with quality. Please note that objects printed using FDM/FFF methods are never perfectly

smooth - layers are usually visible. There are ways to make 3D printed objects smoother, though. Check our blog at blog.prusa3d.com to learn more about post-processing. In case your print has actual quality issues (missing parts, shifted layers, under-extruded sections), please check our Print Quality Troubleshooting at the end of this handbook. Make sure the steel sheet is clean and put it back onto the heatbed. You can leave the filament loaded in the nozzle. If you don’t plan to print another object, wait until the nozzle cools down to

50 °C and turn the printer off using the switch on the side. 24 6. Advanced features 6.1.

Mesh Bed Leveling explained Mesh bed leveling can be found in LCD Menu - Calibration. This procedure is performed before every print. It is also the same procedure performed at the start of First Layer Calibration (see next

chapter) The SuperPINDA probe goes through a 4x4 grid pattern spread across the sheet (whether it is a powder-coated or smooth PEI does not matter) and measures the distance to the sheet. These points are interpolated and used to create a virtual mesh of the bed. If the bed is slightly warped (we're talking about tiny imperfections introduced either by manufacturing tolerances stacking up or caused by the assembly process), the probe will still precisely follow the surface during printing according to its measured mesh, improving the quality of the first layer.

6.3. Factory reset A factory reset can be performed through LCD Menu - Settings - Factory Reset. This will reset all data to default values. 6.4. Network connections Original Prusa MINI+ has an ethernet (RJ45) port onboard. You can use this port to connect your printer to your network. Please note that certain network features may not be fully available in the factory firmware. Keep 26 checking our web www.prusa3d.com or social media profiles where we publish information about updated firmware versions.

You can connect your Original Prusa MINI+ to the local area network (LAN) and access basic information about the printer through web-based interface called PrusaConnect. The printer has DHCP turned on by default. Go to LCD Menu - Settings - LAN Settings and check whether the IP address has been assigned correctly. Then, on your PC or cell phone, open a web browser of your choice and enter the IP address into the address field. This will allow you to see basic information about the current print job. PrusaConnect in the current version works only on local

area network and its features will be expanded in further releases. Wi-Fi module (an optional accessory) is not supported in the default firmware. Information about Wi-Fi module availability will be published at www.prusa3d.com or blog.prusa3d.com. Original Prusa MINI+ is also compatible with a third-party tool for network printing called OctoPrint. Please refer to the official OctoPrint website (www.octoprint.org) for more information on setup and configuration. 27 7. Printing your own models Once the printer is fully calibrated and the sample models are looking good, you will probably

want to print your own model. You have a number of options - read the following chapters to learn more. 7.1. Obtaining a printable model The easiest way to get started with 3D printing is to find models on the internet - they are usually in .3mf, .stl or .obj formats. Fortunately, 3D printing has many fans, so there are sites from which you can download a large variety of ready-made 3D models for free. These range from a simple playing dice to a detailed figure from a favorite movie, game or TV series. You can also

download mechanical parts, RC model accessories, household items and much more. Get the best models at Printables.com! Printables.com (formerly PrusaPrinters.org) is a large online library of high-quality 3D models managed by Prusa Research. The main goal is to bring together a large active community of designers, makers and 3D printing enthusiasts - no matter which 3D printer brand they prefer. There are regular community contests with 3D printers and filaments as the top prizes and there's also a reward system with both virtual and physical goods - simply by being an active

member, you can collect points and exchange them for a spool of Prusament or cool merchandise. With the focus on high-quality, unique and useful models, you are always just a few clicks away from discovering something new and amazing to print. And before you actually download and print something, you can use an advanced built-in 3D model viewer that works with not only STL and 3MF files, but G-Codes as well. Visit Printables.com and discover all sorts of activities, contests, events, groups, collections and more!

28 3D models are very often free to download under the Creative Commons - Attribution - Non- Commercial (Models not to be used commercially, you must always include the name of the author) or for a small fee. We have selected the most interesting sites: www.printables.com www.thingiverse.com www.myminifactory.com www.pinshape.com www.youmagine.com www.shapeways.com www.gambody.com However, models in .stl, .obj or similar formats cannot be 3D printed directly. First, they need to be “sliced” (converted) into a G-code file, which is then placed onto a USB drive. Connect the

USB drive with a sliced project into the printer and select the model to print from the Print menu. Please see the chapters 7.3 What is a G-code file? and 7.4 PrusaSlicer for more information. 7.2. Creating your own models To create a 3D model, you need a dedicated program - a 3D editor. There are a number of various 3D programs and your choice will usually depend on what type of model you wish to create. The easiest place to start is Tinkercad (www.tinkercad.com) - it’s an online editor that runs in

your browser’s window, so no installation is required. It’s free, easy to navigate, and you will find plenty of tutorials online. TinkerCad is mostly focused on creating less-detailed and larger (e.g. mechanical) parts, ideal for FFF/FDM printing - your MINI+ can take care of them easily. Another popular tool is Autodesk Fusion 360 (www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360) for PC, Mac, and iPad. The website provides a quick guide along with detailed video tutorials so it is an ideal choice both for beginning enthusiasts and professionals.

7.3. What is a G-code file? When you download 3D models from the internet or create your own models, you will need to convert the 3D model (.stl, .obj, .3mf and similar formats) into a set of instructions for the printer called G-code. G-code is a file format readable by 3D printers. The file contains information such as nozzle movement, the amount of filament to extrude, temperature settings or fan speeds. There are dozens of slicers available, each with their own advantages and disadvantages. The

three most commonly used slicers among the Prusa printer owners are: PrusaSlicer Cura Simplify3D 7.4. PrusaSlicer As the name suggests, PrusaSlicer is our own in-house developed slicer based on the open-source project Slic3r. It has many useful features such as: Ready to print, auto-updating profiles for over 3 dozen filaments Variable layer height Custom supports and modifier meshes Differential print settings You can always download the latest stable version from www.prusa3d.com/prusaslicer/. Development alpha/beta versions are available at github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer.

12. 7.5. Importing objects into PrusaSlicer Once you start PrusaSlicer, select the Original Prusa MINI+ in the Printer menu on the right side of the window. If it’s not listed, you can add it either by selecting Add a new printer option in the same menu or by going to Configuration -> Configuration Wizard. Then, select the layer height, infill and the material you want to use. Please note that built-in filament profiles have pre-defined and tested settings. If you select a wrong profile, it may affect your print due to incompatible

settings. PrusaSlicer allows you to import STL, OBJ, AMF, and 3MF object files - these are the most common types of 3D files you can find on the internet. You can either drag-and-drop them in the Plater window, or you can use the Add… button in the top toolbar. Next, use the tools in the left toolbar to Move, Scale and Rotate the model. If the object is blue, it means it’s too big for the printing platform. See the next chapter for more details. Every object is different, so there’s no default orientation that would work for every object. The rule of thumb here

30 is to select the largest flat surface of the object as the base - the bigger the base, the better the adhesion. Select a perfectly flat side of the model for the best result. 7.6. Using supports Support material is a 3D-printed supporting structure (similar to a scaffolding) used to print complex objects correctly - you can remove the support material after the print job is finished. You can find many models that can be printed without supports - just place them on the print bed the right way and you can start printing. However, not all objects can be printed without

supports. If you print an object with a gradient lower than 45° (a steep side), the overhangs may not be printed correctly, which can lead to a failed print. You can even find objects that would require the printer to start printing mid-air - which is impossible. This is where supports need to be used. PrusaSlicer has this function built-in. Automatically generated supports in PrusaSlicer You can select from three options: Support on build plate only - generate supports only around the object For support enforcers only - generate supports only where enforcers are

placed Everywhere - generate supports everywhere The default values work in a majority of scenarios. However, if you need to tweak where the supports should be generated, follow these steps: Go to the Print Settings tab and click the Support Material option in the left column. Check the Generate support material box. Overhang threshold lets you set the minimal angle for printing the support material. Setting this item to zero lets the printer detect problematic parts automatically and print support where it is needed.

Enforce support option is used mostly with small models or models with a small base to prevent the object from breaking or tearing out from the bed. 31 Areas above supports usually have a less-than-ideal surface quality. Before you decide to use supports, try to move/rotate the object to find an orientation that will require less or even no supports. 7.7. Print speed vs Print quality Printing a small object takes a few minutes, but printing larger models are more time consuming - there are prints that will take dozens of hours to finish. There are various elements affecting the

print time. The first way to affect the printing speed is to change layer height in PrusaSlicer - the upper right window shows the Print settings option. The default setting is 0.15 mm QUALITY, but you can speed up the printer by choosing the 0.20 mm (SPEED) option - or even 0.25 mm DRAFT quality. Raising the layer height will result in less detailed models with more prominent layers. If you prefer quality over speed, choose a 0.10 mm (DETAIL) option. Printing time will increase noticeably, however, the models will look better. Increasing the printing speed may result

in a less-detailed model. Our most used profiles 0.15 mm and 0.20 mm come in two different versions. Quality - slower perimeters and infill, gives you better surface quality Speed - faster perimeters and infill without much sacrifice of surface quality 32 Print quality vs print time The speed can also be changed while printing. Go to LCD Menu - Tune - Speed. By turning the control knob clockwise you can increase the print speed up to 150 %. Turning the knob counterclockwise decreases the print speed - the minimum speed is 50%. Watch the results of

increased or decreased speed on the printed model and adjust the speed accordingly. Keep in mind that acceleration is unaffected by this value, so the change in speed is not directly proportional to the change in print time. 7.8. Infill Infill is another parameter that affects the printed object - mainly the speed of printing, structural strength and even the look of the printed object. Objects printed with the FFF/FDM method are not solid. Instead, you can find a certain 3D pattern inside these objects. The patterns can range from a simple grid or honeycomb to more

complex shapes. The purpose of the infill remains the same: give the object a certain level of structural strength. Many models can be printed with 10-15% infill, but if you require the model to be stronger (e.g. a structural part), select a denser infill. 7.9. Brim A brim is used to increase adhesion to the print bed and decrease the possibility of warping. This is done by printing extra outlines of the first layer and it’s especially useful when the footprint of the first layer is very small. You can turn it on in PrusaSlicer by ticking a checkbox in the right

panel. When the print is finished, it’s usually very easy to remove brim with hand. Alternatively, you can use a deburring tool or a scalpel to remove the brim. 33 7.10. Large object printing Original Prusa MINI+ has a smaller bed compared to the Original Prusa i3 MK3S, however, with some clever tricks, you can print massive objects with the MINI+ as well. Do not let the smaller print bed stop you - check our blog at blog.prusa3d.com to learn how to assemble large models from several smaller parts.

A special case is when you want to print objects larger than the heatbed. The first option is to resize the object to a printable size. Select the Scale tool from the left menu (or press the S key). Then use the 3D gizmo to change the scale of the object. If you want to scale the model uniformly, drag the scale gizmo by one of its corners. You can also change the size of a model along one of the axes by dragging the corresponding gizmo handles. Alternatively, you can use the object manipulation window in the bottom right corner to type in an

exact scale value. Changing the scale of a printed object If you need to print an object that does not fit the printer at its original scale, you have to cut the object into smaller pieces. Select the Cut tool from the left menu (or press the C key). Position the cut plane to the desired position or enter a precise height into the Cut dialog window. You can decide whether you want to keep the upper, lower or both object parts. 34 Cutting the object with the Cut option 7.11. Print multi-colored objects

There is a simple way to create layer-based multi-colored 3D prints directly in PrusaSlicer - see the instructions below. Multicolored object printed using color change feature in PrusaSlicer 35 Color change in PrusaSlicer Switch to the layer preview using the button in the lower-left corner 1. Using the slider on the right side, select a layer where the color change should 2. occur Click on the orange plus icon 3. A preview is instantly displayed. You can remove the color change by clicking 4. on the grey cross button that is now displayed instead of the orange plus

button Export the G-code and you’re ready to print! 5. Setting up color change in PrusaSlicer 7.12. Slicing, exporting One of the most important parts of the slicing process is the inspection of the sliced object in the Preview window. Use the slider on the right side of the window to go through all the layers of the sliced object. This will help you to uncover possible problematic spots - e.g. when the bottom of the object doesn’t sit directly on the bed or when there are supports missing and some

parts of the object start mid-air. Before you export the model as a G-code and place it onto a USB drive, always make sure to inspect the object in the preview mode. It’s the best way to prevent possible printing issues. 36 8. Material guide See the full material guide online! Please note that due to the limited space in this handbook, we can offer only a short overview of the most popular filaments. Visit help.prusa3d.com/materials for a complete detailed overview of a vast majority of available

filaments. The Original Prusa MINI+ can print with many popular materials. Materials vary in both mechanical and optical properties as well as in the ease of use. If you’re new to 3D printing, your first filament should definitely be PLA. Only when you are limited by some of PLA’s disadvantages, it’s time to try other filaments like PETG or ASA. 8.1. PLA PLA is the most commonly used material for 3D printing. It is easy to print with, and PLA prints are very hard. It’s the perfect choice for printing large objects due to low thermal expansion (prints

do not warp on the heatbed) and for printing small detailed models. It is the only material that is well suited for printing 50-micron layers (Ultradetail resolution) and it can be also used to produce great-looking miniatures. Advantages Disadvantages • Easy to print, suitable for beginners • Detailed prints of small models • Trouble-free printing of large objects • Almost odorless • Affordable • Wide color selection • Brittle and inflexible • Low-temperature resistance (54 °C) • Difficult to post-process

• Not suitable for outdoor use (low UV and temperature resistance) Typical use • prototypes • toys • figures • jewelry (tiny and detailed models) • architecture models Tips and tricks Best printed on a smooth PEI sheet. When post-processing PLA, use wet sanding to achieve a perfectly smooth surface. Without water, you'll quickly start heating the plastic by friction - the object can melt locally. PLA is only soluble in chemicals like chloroform or hot benzene. The preferred option for connecting multiple parts is superglue or acetone.

Nozzle temperature: 215 °C Bed temperature: 50 - 60 °C Heatbed: Make sure the surface is clean, as described in 9.1 Flexible steel sheet surface preparation chapter 37 8.2. PET/PETG PETG is another commonly used material for 3D printing. It is a great choice for printing mechanical components. Compared to PLA, it has higher temperature resistance, is more ductile and therefore less brittle. Due to its low thermal expansion it holds well on the heatbed and does not warp. Printing with it is almost as easy as with PLA. But unlike PLA, it can offer

better mechanical properties. Parts for our printers are printed from PETG! Advantages Disadvantages • High-temperature resistance • Easy to print • Low warping • Tough and durable • Easy post-processing (sanding) • Almost odorless • Glossy surface • Good layer adhesion • Water and humidity resistant • Not suitable for printing small/detailed models • Possible stringing • Poor bridging and overhangs • Strong adhesion to the printbed • Cannot be smoothed with acetone, soluble only in dangerous chemicals

• Supports can be difficult to remove Typical use • mechanical components • holders and cases • watertight prints (pots) Tips and tricks Unlike PLA, PETG requires a heated bed (85°C). Its bridging- and overhang-behavior is usually worse, plus it is prone to stringing. Stringing can be moderated with higher retractions and lower nozzle temperature, but we suggest using the PrusaSlicer profiles. It’s important to cool the PETG print - this helps to keep the model detailed and prevents stringing and oozing. But if you want the

model to be as tough as possible, try to turn off the print fan. Higher filament temperature improves merging between layers, which leads to better mechanical resistance. Otherwise, we recommend printing the first few layers with the print fan off to prevent deformation, then with the fan running at half its power. Nozzle temperature: 240 °C Bed temperature: 80 - 100 °C Heatbed: Textured powder-coated sheets and satin sheets require no special preparation, simply keep the surface clean and grease-free. With smooth PEI sheets, you should apply a thin layer of

paper glue (glue stick) onto the surface, because PETG may stick too well to the surface of the sheet, making it extremely difficult to remove. 8.3. ASA/ABS ASA and ABS are very similar materials. ASA is many ways even better than ABS and can be considered a successor to ABS. ASA is UV stable compared to ABS (less yellowing) and shrinks somewhat less when printed. The only advantage of ABS is the easier surface treatment with acetone. Going forward, we will only talk about ASA, but the same goes for ABS.

ASA is a strong and versatile material. A higher melting point than PLA gives ASA excellent heat resistance, your prints will not show signs of deformation up to around 100 °C. Unfortunately, ASA has a very high thermal expansion compared to PLA, which complicates printing, especially for larger models. Even with a heated bed set to 100 °C, the print can begin to warp and peel off the bed. The material also produces an unpleasant odor during printing. 38 Advantages Disadvantages • High impact and wear resistance

• Very good temperature resistance • Suitable for outdoor use - UV stable • Soluble in acetone - easy to glue together • Can be smoothed with acetone vapors • Detailed prints with no stringing • Easy postprocessing (e.g. sanding, cutting etc.) • Difficult to print • Tendency to warp (large models should be printed in an enclosure) • Unpleasant odor during printing (contains styrene) Typical use • covers and protective cases • prototypes • replacement parts • toys and figures Tips and tricks Printing with ASA/ABS is much easier when done inside an enclosure. The heated bed will

quickly heat the enclosure and reduce the thermal shock on the extruded filament. As a result, both warping and layer separation is decreased significantly. Acetone makes it easy to glue multiple prints together. All you have to do is rub the contact surfaces lightly with acetone and press the parts together. In addition, prints can be smoothed with acetone vapor to give a perfectly glossy finish. Be careful when handling acetone! Nozzle temperature: 245 - 265 °C Bed temperature: 90 - 100 °C. (a larger object requires a higher temperature)

Heatbed: ASA and ABS materials work the best with the satin sheet, which requires no special preparation - simply keep it clean and grease-free. However, if you print ABS/ASA on a textured or smooth sheet, you need to apply a thin layer of paper glue (glue stick) onto the surface of the sheet because ASA and ABS may stick too well to these types of surfaces, making them extremely difficult to remove. 8.4. PC (Polycarbonate) and PC Blend Polycarbonate (PC) is a technical material with great tenacity, tensile strength, and heat

resistance. However, it’s very hard to print, therefore suitable mainly for advanced users. However, this doesn't apply to our Prusament PC Blend, which is significantly easier to print compared to other polycarbonates. Advantages Disadvantages • High-temperature resistance • High impact tenacity and tensile strength • Pure polycarbonate is transparent • Good electric insulation properties • Pure polycarbonate is highly hygroscopic • High nozzle and bed temperature • High warping, especially with large models

• Moderate odor during printing • Application of a separation layer is recommended • High price 39 Typical use: The best use of PC is for printing technical parts requiring great heat and mechanical resistance. Tips and tricks: Consider using an enclosure to prevent warping of objects being printed Use a Skirt in PrusaSlicer to reduce warping Add Brim around small objects Do not print in cold areas Nozzle temperature: 275 °C Bed Temperature: 110 °C for the first layer, 115 °C for ther est Heatbed: Powder-coated TXT or satin sheet with a glue stick will provide the best adhesion. Note

that while the powder-coated satin sheet has good adhesion even without a glue stick, it is recommended to use a separation layer to prevent surface wear/damage. 8.5. PVB Polyvinyl butyral (PVB) is a material designed for easy smoothing with isopropyl alcohol (IPA). Thanks to its transparency, it’s suitable for printing vases, lamp shades and other design objects. Print settings are similar to PLA, while its mechanical properties are slightly better. Advantages Disadvantages • Print settings similar to PLA

• Filament transparency • Ideal for design parts, vases, lamp shades etc. • IPA chemical smoothing • Great surface adhesion • Good tenacity (similar to CPE) • Good tensile strength (similar to PETG) • Low warping (lower than PLA) • Good for using 0.8mm nozzle • Low layer to layer adhesion • Hygroscopic filament (absorbs moisture) • Higher price Typical use: The best use of PVB is for printing transparent models, such as jewellery, vases, lamp shades etc. Tips and tricks: PVB adheres well to a clean smooth PEI sheet or satin TXT sheet. Powder-coated

TXT sheet might not provide a good adhesion. When printing transparent parts that require IPA smoothing, it’s good to print with a larger nozzle diameter (0.8mm) and with the spiral vase mode on. Printing with more perimeters will make layers visible even after IPA smoothing. Keep the filament dry: PVB is very prone to absorbing moisture. Always put the spool back inside the bag with silica gel or let it dry for 4 hours at 60 °C before printing! The main advantage of PVB is the possibility of IPA smoothing. PVB models can be smoothed out

with IPA fumes (smoothing box or professional smoothing station), washing in an IPA bath or direct application (brush or spray). Detailed smoothing description can be found in our dedicated article, general smoothing instructions can be found in our older article. Nozzle temperature: 215±10°C Bed temperature: 75°C Heatbed: Do not use standard powder-coated TXT sheet. PVB adheres well to a clean smooth PEI sheet or satin TXT sheet. Powder-coated TXT sheet might not provide a good adhesion. 8.6. Flexible Materials

Flexible filaments are very strong and elastic materials. In many cases, classic hard plastics may not be suitable for printing a specific model. Whether you are printing a phone cover, an action 40 camera case, or an RC car wheel, it is better to use a flexible material. However, these materials are relatively uncommon, expensive, and suitable mostly for advanced users due to high print difficulty. Before you print from Flex, clean the nozzle from any previous material. Start by preheating to the

highest temperature you’ve recently printed at. Then load PLA into the extruder to push out any previous material. When inserting Flex, loosen the pressure on the idler as much as possible. Consider using the "Cold Pull" method to clean the nozzle - see help.prusa3d.com for more details. Print slowly. The slower, the better. A typical speed for flexible filaments is usually 20 mm/s, the maximal recommended speed is somewhere between 30 and 40 mm/s. With higher speeds, you risk clogging the nozzle or tangling filament into the gears. For Original Prusa

printers, we recommend using the “Semiflex or Flexfill 98A” or “Filatech FilaFlex40” profiles that have proper speed settings. Advantages Disadvantages • Flexibility and elasticity • Minimal warping • Good layer adhesion • Abrasion resistance • It requires extra steps to load the filament • More demanding to prepare and print, bad bridging and overhangs • Must be printed slowly • Higher price • Hygroscopic - must be stored in a dry environment Nozzle temperature: 230 - 260 °C Bed temperature: 45 - 65 °C (a larger object requires a higher temperature)

Heatbed: If you print on a smooth sheet, apply a separation layer on it (glue stick or Kapton tape should work). The powder-coated sheets do not need any separation layer - the print will stick just fine and can be easily removed without damaging the surface. 9. Regular Maintenance We have designed the MINI+ as a reliable 3D printing workhorse, however, it’s still a machine with moving parts, which means it requires maintenance from time to time. Following the instructions below will ensure that your 3D printer will remain in good shape for a long time.

9.1. Steel sheets If the printed objects have trouble adhering to the steel sheet surface, you need to wipe the sheet clean. Choose the right cleaning product for your sheet (see below), pour a small amount of it onto an unscented paper towel and wipe the print surface. The bed should be cleaned while cold to achieve the best results - cleaning the bed when hot can lead to potential injury, either from the heatbed or from the nozzle. When cleaning at higher temperatures, the alcohol will evaporate

before it can clean anything. More details can be found in the Your First Print chapter at the beginning of this handbook. The surface does not have to be cleaned before every print! It is just important not to touch the steel sheet with your hands or dirty tools. Recommended cleaning products for different types of sheets are listed below. For instructions on how to use specific materials (e.g. the need to apply a separation layer to prevent surface damage), see the previous chapter. 41 Proper usage:

Risks and hazards: Smooth PEI sheet • Isopropyl alcohol 90%+ (IPA) is the best degreaser. DO NOT use hand sanitizers and similar products even though they may contain IPA, since they usually contain lubricants and moisturizers! • Warm water + a few drops with dish soap (in case IPA doesn’t remove sugar residue on the sheet) • Acetone - once in a while to rejuvenate the sheet • Use a glue stick when printing FLEX • IPA + PETG will cause the print to adhere very strongly to the sheet. Removing it could be

extremely difficult. Materials such as PETG, ASA, ABS, PC, CPE, PP and FLEX should be printed only with a separation layer (gluestick). Textured powder-coated sheet • Isopropyl alcohol 90%+ (IPA) - best degreaser • Never use acetone Satin powder-coated sheet • Suitable for both PLA and PETG • Isopropyl alcohol 90%+ (IPA) - best degreaser • No need for glue stick when printing FlexFill 98A • Wide range of supported materials; including advanced materials such as PC Blend • Never use acetone! • Prints from ASA and PC

Blend require a brim / skirt / shield around the print • Do not use sharp objects to remove the print from the sheet's surface! Calibration values might be slightly different for different steel print sheets because the coating thickness varies. If you just switched the steel sheets, visually inspect the quality of the first layer and adjust the nozzle height accordingly with Live Adjust Z when switching between different types of steel sheets. New firmware versions have built-in steel sheet profiles to save your calibration values.

Consumable parts, such as PEI sheets (smooth, textured, etc.) are not covered by our warranty because the coatings are designed to diminish over time unless failure has occurred due to a defect in materials or workmanship. Cosmetic damage, including but not limited to scratches, dents, cracks or other cosmetic damage is also not covered by the warranty. Only sheets that are defective on arrival are covered by warranty. The surface does not have to be cleaned before every print! It is just important to not touch the

steel sheet with your hands or dirty tools. All original print surfaces by Prusa Research are coated from both sides 42 Smooth PEI sheet, Textured powder-coated PEI and the effect on the first layer 9.2. Spring steel sheet with TEXTURED double-sided PEI • Scratch-proof surface, damage-resistant • Transfers texture onto the first layers of your prints • More forgiving Live Adjust Z setting • No need for glue stick with FLEX • Prints usually detach automatically once the sheet cools down • The first layer can be more squished (see Live

Z calibration chapter) compared to smooth sheets • PLA prints with a small contact area may need a brim • PLA prints with a huge footprint (across the entire sheet) may warp • Need to change Live Adjust Z if you also own Smooth PEI sheet • Never clean with acetone The powder coating applied directly onto metal helped us create a build plate that is highly damage-resistant. If a heated nozzle crashes into it, metal can dissipate the heat. Powder coating also gives the surface a distinct textured look that will be visible on your prints.

The textured surface hides most of the mechanical damage caused by various tools. Only the top of the small bumps can be scratched, however, these scratches will not affect the bottom of the model. Never clean the textured powder-coated sheet with acetone! Doing so will create microfractures in the PEI texture, which will cause the surface to deteriorate over time. This surface is used on our print farm, look at the printed parts you have on your printer for reference. 43 9.3. Spring steel sheet with SMOOTH double-sided PEI

• Perfect for PLA • Great adhesion with almost all materials • Smooth bottom of prints • Tiny details will stick great • Rejuvenate with acetone from time to time • Do not clean with IPA when printing with PETG. Release agent might be necessary. • You must apply glue stick when printing materials such as PETG, ASA, ABS, PC, CPE, PP, Flex and others. See the Material Guide chapter to learn more. • Need to change Live Adjust Z if you also own the textured PEI sheet The industrial glue which holds the PEI sheet on the heatbed itself softens when

temperatures greater than 110 °C are used. If higher temperatures are used, the glue can migrate under the PEI and create slight bumps on the surface. If you notice small bubbles forming under the PEI sheet simply flip the sheet over and print on the other side. These bubbles do not affect the print quality and will disappear after a few days or weeks. 9.4. Spring steel sheet with SATIN double-sided PEI • Suitable both for PLA and PETG • Lightly textured surface finish • Clean only with high-quality isopropyl alcohol

(90%+) • No need for glue stick with FlexFill 98A • Wide range of supported materials, including advanced materials such as PC Blend • Easy maintenance and good adhesion qualities • Do not use acetone. Acetone causes the surface to quickly deteriorate • Prints from ASA and PC Blend require a brim / skirt / shield around the print • Live Z value needs to be readjusted if you switch sheets (see chapter about Steel Sheet Profiles) • DO NOT use sharp metal objects (e.g. a metal spatula) to remove the print from the surface.

9.5. Increasing the adhesion In some special cases, such as printing a tall object with a very small contact area (with the print surface), you might need to increase the adhesion. Fortunately, PEI is a very chemically resistant polymer and you can temporarily apply various adhesion solutions without damaging it. This also applies to certain materials that would not stick to PEI under normal circumstances. Check the material guide for material-specific instructions. Always stick to safe removal techniques

described in this handbook and/or at help.prusa3d.com. Before applying anything onto the bed, consider using the Brim option in PrusaSlicer which increases the surface area of the first layer. 9.6. Steel sheet profiles Both the smooth PEI and textured powder-coated PEI sheets have their advantages as explained in the previous chapters. It is possible that you might have both of them and switch between them based on your current needs. However, swapping sheets requires an extra step: you need to calibrate the Live Z value every time you switch sheets - this is because various sheets have

various thickness. 44 To avoid re-calibrating the Live Z value every time you switch sheets, we are introducing Steel Sheet Profiles (starting with firmware 4.3.0). Navigate to LCD Menu - Settings - HW Setup - Sheet profiles to find a list of sheet profiles. Select a profile and perform the first layer calibration. This will save the Live Z value into the selected sheet profile. Do this for every sheet you own and you can then switch between them easily, either from the Sheet profiles menu, or directly from the Settings menu - look for the name of the sheet in brackets. Click the item to

switch to another profile - only profiles with valid first layer calibration are displayed. By default, you will see the following profiles in the Sheet profiles menu: smooth1, smooth2, textured1, textured2, custom1, custom2. Select any of them to display the following options: Select - confirms the selection of the sheet, which will then become the default First layer calibration - starts the first layer calibration process for the selected sheet profile Reset - sets the first layer calibration values back to the factory defaults.

9.7. Bearings After a couple hundred hours of printing, the smooth rods should be cleaned with a paper towel. The MINI+ comes with a tube of Prusa lubricant and you can also buy it in our e-shop in the Accessories section. Apply it onto the smooth rods (XYZ axes). Then, move the X-axis by hand left and right a couple of times and use the printer’s menu to move the Z-axis up and down. Move the heatbed back and forth on the Y-axis. For our detailed maintenance guide, please head to help.prusa3d.com.

If you feel that one of the axes doesn’t move smoothly anymore, the bearings can be taken out and greased on the inside (they need to be removed from axis because the plastic lip will prevent most of the grease from getting inside). 9.8. Fans Both fans measure current RPM (Revolutions Per Minute), meaning they can detect when the fan suddenly slows down, e.g. due to a piece of filament getting stuck in it. If you get a fan error, check that it can rotate freely; clear any debris that may be stuck in it. Do not try to bypass the fan

checks - heated parts could overheat, causing damage to the printer. Both fans should be checked and cleaned every couple hundred hours. Computer cleaner spray (compressed air) will get the dust away and tweezers can be used for little plastic strands. Do not blow compressed air on running fans. 9.9. Extruder drive gear The extruder gears do not need any lubrication. Over time, the extruder gears can suffer from a build-up of filament shavings in the grooves, which can cause under-extrusion. Use

compressed air to blow the debris out or use a small brass brush to clean the grooves, a regular toothpick will do the job as well. Check and clean from the access window on the top of the extruder assembly. Clean what you can, then rotate the gear and repeat. 45 9.10. PTFE tubes The MINI+ has four PTFE tubes that may need a basic level of attention from time to time. PTFE tubes are used to lead filament strand from the spool, through the extruder, all the way to the nozzle. Over time, filament debris can accumulate in the PTFE tubes over time.

Cleaning the PTFE tubes is very easy - use a can with compressed air to clean them. If the PTFE tubes in your printer wear out and filament cannot pass through them correctly, you may encounter a number of different issues: trouble with filament loading, under-extrusion and others. We have prepared the following online guides to help you troubleshoot issues with the PTFE tubes and the nozzle/hotend. Please note that PTFE tubes are consumables and their quality will degrade over time. See our Knowledgebase article on how to solve issues with a clogged

nozzle/hotend at https://help.prusa3d.com/clogged-mini and how to replace the hotend PTFE tube at http://help.prusa3d.com/mini-ptfe The first tube leads to the extruder and it can be pulled out with your hand. If you have trouble 1. disconnecting it, you might need to loosen an M3×12 screw in the extruder. Please see the article "How to access and clean the extruder-pulley (MINI)" at help.prusa3d.com The second tube leads from the extruder to the print head. Use a spanner (size 10) to loosen 2. the nuts - this is also useful if the filament failed to load/unload and got stuck in this tube

Remove the main PTFE tube (as described in Step 2) and also undo the fittings in the extruder 3. or in the print head to access PTFE tube three and four. These only need to be inspected if the filament fails to pass through them. 46 9.11. Clogged / jammed extruder Material clogged in the extruder can cause problems with the printing or with the loading of a new filament. On the right side of the extruder (when viewed from the front), there’s a screw right under the PTFE tube. You can use this screw to increase or decrease the idler’s pressure. If you remove the

screw completely, you can open the idler door on the left side of the extruder - make sure the print head is on the opposite side of the X-axis. Opening the idler will enable you to clean both gears easily and/or remove any filament leftovers 47 caught in the extruder gears. It’s advised to inspect the gears from time to time and remove any debris caught in the extruder Open idler - you can see the strand of loaded filament inside 9.12. Nozzle cleaning Do not touch the nozzle during these procedures - it’s very hot and it may cause burns!

To make cleaning easier, move the print head all the way up in the LCD menu - Settings - Move axis - Move Z axis. You will gain better access to the hotend. 9.12.1. The filament is being extruded just a little If the filament doesn’t go through the extruder smoothly and only a small volume is coming out, first check if the extruder fan is working properly and that the temperature is set correctly (PLA 215 °C; ASA 260 °C, PETG 230 °C). Also, check that the filament was correctly loaded into the extruder.

If that is not the case. Follow the instructions below: Heat the nozzle according to the filament you want to print from. Load the filament and push 1. an acupuncture needle (bundled with the printer) or a thin wire (0.3-0.35 mm) into the nozzle from below - between 1 and 2 cm deep. Wearing gloves is recommended - melted material may pour out unexpectedly. Choose Load filament option from the LCD menu and check if the filament is extruded 2. properly. Push the acupuncture needle or wire into the nozzle again and repeat these steps several

3. times. When the filament is extruded properly, the nozzle is clear. 48 9.12.2. The filament is not pushed out of the nozzle If you can see the filament passing through the main PTFE tube, yet none of the filament is going through the nozzle, then most likely, your hotend got clogged. In order to fully clear it, please follow these instructions: Heat the nozzle according to the filament you want to print from. Load the filament and push 1. an acupuncture needle (bundled with the printer) or a thin wire (0.3-0.35 mm) into the

nozzle from below - between 1 and 2 cm deep. Wearing gloves is recommended - melted material may pour out unexpectedly. Choose Load filament option from the LCD menu and check if the filament is extruded 2. properly. Push the acupuncture needle or wire into the nozzle again and repeat these steps several 3. times. When the filament is extruded properly, the nozzle is clear. 9.13. Replacing / changing the nozzle If you are replacing the Olsson Ruby nozzle, please visit this website for instructions,

otherwise, you might damage it - support.3dverkstan.se/article/66-the-olsson-ruby- instructions-for-use CAUTION: Heated parts can cause severe burns! Be extra careful around the hotend thermistor leads. You can break them off easily 49 Heat the nozzle according to the filament you want to print from. Load the filament and push 1. an acupuncture needle (bundled with the printer) or a thin wire (0.3-0.35 mm) into the nozzle from below - between 1 and 2 cm deep. Wearing gloves is recommended - melted

material may pour out unexpectedly. Choose Load filament option from the LCD menu and check if the filament is extruded 2. properly. Push the acupuncture needle or wire into the nozzle again and repeat these steps several 3. times. When the filament is extruded properly, the nozzle is clear. Proper usage: 4. Risks and hazards: 5. Insert a filament and you are ready to print. 6. The nozzle is hot during this whole process and can cause burns! Be careful around the hotend thermistor leads, you can break them easily!

50 You can bend the heatbreak easily - do not use excessive force! Run First layer calibration after changing the nozzle! 9.14. Flashing unsigned firmware We take safety very seriously. Before every release, our firmware goes through intense testing to verify that all safety features work properly. If any of the sensor readings fall out of line, heating is stopped to prevent any possible damage to the printer and its surroundings. We cannot verify that these safety features are present in community-made firmwares.

Official firmware is signed with a private key and the printer verifies this signature before an update. To flash your own (or a community-made) unsigned firmware, you’ll have to break the appendix on the Buddy board and move the jumper into the correct position. This also voids your warranty on electronics. First, pull out the power switch to access the appendix (1). Then take a thin screwdriver and carefully break off the middle part (2) - see the pictures in this chapter! Also, check the three pins above it - there must be a jumper on the two pins closer to

the center of the board. It’s possible that the jumper is installed on a different set of pins - in that case, move it according to the picture below. If the jumper is missing, add it before booting. Breaking the appendix on the Buddy board is IRREVERSIBLE and VOIDS WARRANTY OF YOUR PRINTER’S ELECTRONICS. If you break the appendix, we disclaim responsibility for any possible damage done to the printer and/or its surroundings (e.g. in case of a fire). 51 Unbroken (left) and broken appendix (right), the correct location of the jumper (lower photo)

10. Filament sensor (optional accessory) You can buy a mechanical IR sensor as an optional accessory for the Original Prusa MINI+. The sensor is installed onto the end of the PTFE tube where you insert the filament into the printer, and it needs to be connected to the mainboard. It uses a simple mechanism to detect whether a strand of filament is inserted or not. Thanks to the filament sensor, the printer can pause the print in case you run out of filament. Once you insert a new filament strand, you can resume the

print. 52 Installation instructions can be found at help.prusa3d.com. 10.0.1. Running out of filament In case you have the optional filament sensor, running out of filament will no longer cause a print failure. If you run out of filament, the printer will automatically pause the print, unload the remaining few centimeters in the heatbreak, and move the X-carriage away from the print. You will be prompted to replace the spool and insert a new filament strand. Use pliers to remove the filament extruded during the loading process. Once this is done, you can continue in the current

print. If you don’t have the filament sensor, it’s possible that once you run out of filament, the remaining strand will be left in the main PTFE tube and the extruder won’t be able to pull it out. Use a spanner to unscrew the nut on the main PTFE tube and disconnect it from the extruder. Then, manually, pull the filament strand out - don’t forget to preheat the nozzle! See chapter PTFE tubes for exact instructions on how to remove the PTFE tube. 10.0.2. False sensor readings and debugging If you encounter issues with the filament sensor, such as incorrect (or random) readings, please

make sure that the sensor is connected properly. Follow the steps in the assembly guide at help.prusa3d.com (Original Prusa MINI+ assembly - Building your MINI+ - 27. Connecting the filament sensor) and open the electronics box cover. Inspect whether the filament sensor is connected correctly and that the wiring is not damaged. Contact our tech support if the issue persists. 11. FAQ - common issues and how to solve them Starting with firmware 4.3, the MINI+ will display an error screen with a short explanation of the

issue it encountered. This screen also contains a link to a relevant article at help.prusa3d.com, and a QR code, which you can scan with your mobile phone to display the help page. 11.1. Skewed X-axis If Mesh Bed Leveling fails, there are two possible causes of this: a faulty SuperPINDA sensor, or a skewed X-axis. The latter is usually the result of incorrect assembly. Loosen the three screws that connect the whole Z-axis assembly to the Y-axis (heatbed). Re-attach the Z-axis according to the assembly manual. Pay special attention to the correct alignment of both parts.

Once the 3D printer is reassembled, move the Z-axis (nozzle) close to the steel sheet without touching it. Then, carefully move the print head from left to right by hand and observe, whether the nozzle keeps the same distance from the sheet all the time. Slight deviations are allowed, since the printer can compensate for them thanks to the Mesh Bed Leveling routine. A faulty SuperPINDA sensor can be recognized easily. When you start Mesh Bed Leveling from the Calibration menu, you can see a red light at the top of the sensor. If it turns off during a certain

movement or it doesn’t light up at all, then the sensor or its cable can be defective. More details can be found at help.prusa3d.com - see Original Prusa MINI+ - Troubleshooting - XZ-axis skew correction. 53 11.2. Printer can’t read the USB drive If the printer can’t read the USB drive, first try restarting the printer. In case you see an error say “Error mounting USB drive”, your USB drive probably has an incompatible filesystem (e.g. exFAT) or may be too large. Try using a smaller FAT32-formatted USB drive (e.g. 4-16 GB). Please visit

help.prusa3d.com - section Original Prusa MINI+ - About your printer - SD cards and USB drives to learn more about supported sizes and formatting options. There are two common situations after inserting the USB drive: The Print menu is inaccessible after inserting a USB drive First, restart the device Use a USB drive with a single partition and FAT32 file system Try a different USB drive If you tried various USB drives and they are still not recognized, your motherboard might be defective. Contact our tech support.

The USB drive is recognized, but no files are shown in the list Make sure you’re using a compatible G-code Make sure the file was written onto the drive fully and correctly (use the safe remove function in Windows before you remove the USB drive) Try a different flash drive and G-code file Try renaming the file to something simple, e.g. print.gcode 11.3. Loose X- and/or Y-axis belts Check if both belts are properly tightened, loose belts would cause a printer malfunction and prevent proper printing. The easiest way to check is printing a round object - if any of the belts are

not tightened properly the result is an irregular shape instead of a perfect circle. Y-axis belt is located under the heatbed, X-axis belt moves the print head. You can find a detailed guide at help.prusa3d.com, section Original Prusa MINI+ - Using the printer - Printer maintenance - Adjusting belt tension (MINI+). 11.4. Filament stuck in the PTFE tube If a filament strand gets stuck anywhere in the printer, it’s generally very easy to remove it. Follow the steps described in the Clogged / jammed extruder chapter - disconnect the main PTFE tube

and inspect where the filament got stuck and proceed accordingly. 11.5. X-Axis homing fails This is most likely caused by the cables leading from the print head to the extruder getting in the way. When the print head is about to hit the right side of the printer (the Z-axis tower), pay close attention whether there are no cables blocking the way. If you have the assembly kit version, make sure that the cables leading from the extruder to the print head have sufficient leeway. If they are too short, they may prevent the print head from

reaching the end of the X-axis. 11.6. Heating errors If your printer stops with a red screen and error related to heating, please check the wiring of the heaters and thermistors. See help.prusa3d.com for more details. 54 11.7. Fan errors If your printer stops operating and displays an error related to fans, please check the wiring of both print head fans (hotend fan and print fan). See help.prusa3d.com for more details. 11.8. Downgrading the firmware In some cases, you might need to downgrade the firmware to an older version. To do this, place an

older firmware file onto a FAT32-formatted USB drive. Insert the drive into the printer, press the restart button and once the screen shows the Original Prusa MINI+ logo, press the knob once. This will activate the firmware flashing screen. Select Flash to overwrite the current firmware with the one placed on the USB drive. 11.9. Nozzle hitting the sheet and similar issues If you have trouble with the first layer calibration or mesh bed levelling, double-check the printer's wiring. Make sure you connected all the cables leading to the electronics box correctly.

If you have the assembly kit version of the MINI+, make sure that the SuperPINDA probe is in the correct position. If the probe is too high / too low, it can cause issues with calibration and selftest. 12. Advanced hardware troubleshooting Starting with firmware 4.3, the MINI+ will display an error screen with a short explanation of the issue it encountered. This screen also contains a link to a relevant article at help.prusa3d.com, and a QR code, which you can scan with your mobile phone to display the help page.

Advanced hardware troubleshooting and part replacement guides are available online through help.prusa3d.com. 13. Print quality troubleshooting If you feel your prints are not fully up-to-specs, or they display some serious quality issues (shifted layers, ghosting, under-extruded parts), you may need to run some troubleshooting.

Getting started with Raspberry Pi Pico-series Table of contents 3 Chapter 1. Introduction To follow this guide you will need the following: • Raspberry Pi Pico-series device • a Micro USB cable The following are required for some of the later steps: • Raspberry Pi Debug Probe, or a second Raspberry Pi Pico-series device The following instructions assume that you are using a Pico-series device; some details may differ if you use a different Raspberry Pi microcontroller-based board. Pico-series devices are built around microcontrollers designed by Raspberry Pi. Development on the boards is fully

supported with both a C/C++ SDK, and an official MicroPython port. This book talks about how to get started with the SDK, and walks you through how to build, install, and work with the SDK toolchain.  TIP The main method covered in this book uses a VS Code extension to make your life easy. If you would like to set up your development environment manually, see Manually Configure your Environment. For more information on the official MicroPython port, see: • the documentation for the Raspberry Pi Pico-series Python SDK

• the Raspberry Pi Press book Get Started with MicroPython on Raspberry Pi Pico - 2nd Edition For more information on the C/C++ SDK, see the documentation for the Raspberry Pi Pico-series C/C++ SDK. Getting started with Raspberry Pi Pico-series Chapter 1. Introduction 4 Chapter 2. Install Visual Studio Code Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a popular open source editor developed by Microsoft. The Raspberry Pi Pico VS Code Extension makes it easy to install dependencies and build software for Pico-series devices.

 TIP If you don’t want to use VS Code, you can either use VSCodium (the community-driven libre alternative) or configure your environment manually. To install Visual Studio Code (VS Code) on Raspberry Pi OS or Linux, run the following commands: $ sudo apt update $ sudo apt install code On macOS and Windows, you can install VS Code from https://code.visualstudio.com/Download. On macOS, you can also install VS Code with brew using the following command: $ brew install --cask visual-studio-code Getting started with Raspberry Pi Pico-series

Chapter 2. Install Visual Studio Code 5 Chapter 3. Install the Raspberry Pi Pico VS Code Extension The Raspberry Pi Pico VS Code extension helps you create, develop, run, and debug projects in Visual Studio Code. It includes a project generator with many templating options, automatic toolchain management, one click project compilation, and offline documentation of the Pico SDK. The VS Code extension supports all Raspberry Pi Pico-series devices. 3.1. Install Dependencies 3.1.1. Raspberry Pi OS and Windows

No dependencies needed. 3.1.2. Linux Most Linux distributions come preconfigured with all of the dependencies needed to run the extension. However, some distributions may require additional dependencies. The extension requires the following: • Python 3.9 or later • Git • Tar • a native C and C++ compiler (the extension supports GCC) You can install these with: $ sudo apt install python3 git tar build-essential 3.1.3. macOS To install all requirements for the extension on macOS, run the following command:

$ xcode-select --install This installs the following dependencies: • Git • Tar • A native C and C++ compiler (the extension supports GCC and Clang) Getting started with Raspberry Pi Pico-series 3.1. Install Dependencies 6 3.2. Install the Extension You can find the extension in the VS Code Extensions Marketplace. Search for the Raspberry Pi Pico extension, published by Raspberry Pi. Click the Install button to add it to VS Code. Figure 1. Debugging in VS Code. You can find the store entry at https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=raspberry-pi.raspberry-pi-pico.

You can find the extension source code and release downloads at https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-vscode. When installation completes, check the Activity sidebar (by default, on the left side of VS Code). If installation was successful, a new sidebar section appears with a Raspberry Pi Pico icon, labelled "Raspberry Pi Pico Project". Getting started with Raspberry Pi Pico-series 3.2. Install the Extension 7 Chapter 4. Load and debug a project The VS Code extension can create projects based on the examples provided by Pico Examples. For an example, we’ll

walk you through how to create a project that blinks the LED on your Pico-series device: 1. In the VS Code left sidebar, select the Raspberry Pi Pico icon, labelled "Raspberry Pi Pico Project". 2. Select New Project from Examples. 3. In the Name field, select the blink example. 4. Choose the board type that matches your device. 5. Specify a folder where the extension can generate files. VS Code will create the new project in a sub-folder of the selected folder. 6. Click Create to create the project.

The extension will now download the SDK and the toolchain, install them locally, and generate the new project. The first project may take 5-10 minutes to install the toolchain. VS Code will ask you whether you trust the authors because we’ve automatically generated the .vscode directory for you. Select yes. Figure 2. Creating a project in VS Code. NOTE The CMake Tools extension may display some notifications at this point. Ignore and close them. On the left Explorer sidebar in VS Code, you should now see a list of files.

Open blink.c to view the blink example source code in the main window. The Raspberry Pi Pico extension adds some capabilities to the status bar at the bottom right of the screen. Compile Compiles the sources and builds the target UF2 file. You can copy this binary onto your device to program it. Run Finds a connected device, flashes the code into it, and runs that code. Getting started with Raspberry Pi Pico-series Chapter 4. Load and debug a project 8 The extension sidebar also contains some quick access functions. Click on the Pico icon in the side menu and you’ll see

Compile Project. Hit Compile Project and a terminal tab will open at the bottom of the screen displaying the compilation progress. 4.1. Compile and Run blink To run the blink example: 1. Hold down the BOOTSEL button on your Pico-series device while plugging it into your development device using a micro USB cable to force it into USB Mass Storage Mode. 2. Press the Run button in the status bar or the Run project button in the sidebar. You should see the terminal tab at the bottom of the window open. It will display information concerning the upload of

the code. Once the code uploads, the device will reboot, and you should see the following output: The device was rebooted to start the application. Your blink code is now running. If you look at your device, the LED should blink twice every second. 4.2. Make a Code Change and Re-run To check that everything is working correctly, click on the blink.c file in VS Code. Navigate to the definition of LED_DELAY_MS at the top of the code: #ifndef LED_DELAY_MS #define LED_DELAY_MS 250 #endif LED_DELAY_MS

1. Change the 250ms (a quarter of a second) to 100 (a tenth of a second): #ifndef LED_DELAY_MS #define LED_DELAY_MS 100 #endif LED_DELAY_MS 2. Disconnect your device, then reconnect while holding the BOOTSEL button. 3. Press the Run button in the status bar or the Run project button in the sidebar. You should see the terminal tab at the bottom of the window open. It will display information concerning the upload of the code. Once the code uploads, the device will reboot, and you should see the following output:

The device was rebooted to start the application. Your blink code is now running. If you look at your device, the LED should flash faster, five times every second. Getting started with Raspberry Pi Pico-series 4.1. Compile and Run blink 9 4.3. Debug The Raspberry Pi Debug Probe is a debug solution for any Arm-based computer. You can use other debug hardware with Pico-series devices, but we recommend the Debug Probe to make configuration as simple as possible. If you’d like to use a Pico-series device as a Debug Probe, see Debug with a second Pico or Pico 2.

First, connect the Debug Probe to your Pico-series device through the debug connector on the board. Depending on which Pico device you have, different connectors will be required. For Pico, Pico W, and Pico 2, use a soldering iron to solder the Debug Probe connectors onto the board. For Pico H, Pico WH, and Pico with headers, the debug header is already added. Just connect the Debug Probe with the supplied cable. Figure 3. Debug Probe wiring For more information, see the Debug Probe documentation.

Now, plug the Debug Probe USB into your computer. The Debug Probe does not power the Pico device, it must be powered separately. To start the debugger: 1. Open the extension sidebar by clicking on the Pico icon. 2. Select Debug Project or press F5. 3. If prompted to select a debugger, choose Pico Debug (Cortex-Debug) The debugger will automatically download the code to the device, insert a breakpoint at the beginning of your main Getting started with Raspberry Pi Pico-series 4.3. Debug 10 function, and run until that breakpoint is hit.

Figure 4. Debugging in VS Code. Once in debugging mode, the sidebar has a number of windows displaying useful information about the current state of the device. At the top, a small control bar contains buttons that control code execution. Hover over the buttons to identify them. To continue code execution click Continue (F5). Your blink code is now running. If you look at your device, the LED should be blinking as before. Now press Restart (Ctrl+Shift+F5) to go back to the beginning of main. Press Step-over (F10) once. The highlighted line, which indicates the next line to be executed, will advance to the

pico_led_init function call. To step into this function, press Step-into (F11). The source window will update to indicate execution is now at the beginning of the function. You can either continue to step over code until the function returns to main, or select Step-out (Shift+F11) to finish executing the function. After returning to the main function, check the Local Variables window to see that the value of rc is 0 (PICO_OK). Press Restart (Ctrl+Shift+F5) again to go back to the beginning of main. Then move the cursor down to the pico_set_led

line and press F9. When you create the breakpoint, you’ll see a red dot indicating the breakpoint location: Getting started with Raspberry Pi Pico-series 4.3. Debug 11 Figure 5. Debugging in VS Code. You can add and remove a breakpoint by clicking on the red dot. Press Continue (F5); execution should halt on the breakpoint. Next, press Step-over (F10) and you should see the LED light up. Getting started with Raspberry Pi Pico-series 4.3. Debug 12 Chapter 5. Say "Hello World" in C After blinking an LED on and off, the next thing that most developers will want to do is create and use a serial port, and

say "Hello World." 5.1. Serial input and output on Pico-series devices Serial input (stdin) and output (stdout) can be directed to serial UART and/or to USB CDC (USB serial). With a serial UART console, the input and output are sent over the UART pins on the device - by default it will use Pin 1 (GP0) for sending output (UART0_TX) and Pin 2 (GP1) for receiving input (UART0_RX). You will then need to connect the UART pins on the Pico-series device to a UART to USB converter, such as the Debug Probe, as shown in the Debug Probe

Wiring diagram. With a USB CDC console, the input and ouput are sent directly over the USB cable connected to your computer, so no additional wiring will be needed. However you may miss some of the printout when your code starts running, as your computer may take a second or two to connect to the Pico-series device after it restarts. You can select either or both consoles when using the extension, depending on your preference. 5.2. Create a project NOTE The SDK makes use of CMake to control its build system, see Manually Create your own Project if you don’t want to

use the VS Code extension 1. In the VS Code left sidebar, select the Raspberry Pi Pico icon, labelled "Raspberry Pi Pico Project". 2. Select New Project. 3. In the Name field, name your project. For example "hello_world". 4. Choose the board type that matches your device. 5. Specify a folder where the extension can generate files. VS Code will create the new project in a sub-folder of the selected folder. 6. Under "STDIO support", select which consoles you would like 7. Click Create to create the project.

The extension will now generate the new project. VS Code will ask you whether you trust the authors because we’ve automatically generated the .vscode directory for you. Select yes. 5.3. Build your project To run the "Hello world" example: 1. Hold down the BOOTSEL button on your Pico-series device while plugging it into your development device using a micro USB cable to force it into USB Mass Storage Mode. 2. Press the Run button in the status bar or the Run project button in the sidebar. Getting started with Raspberry Pi Pico-series

5.1. Serial input and output on Pico-series devices 13 You should see the terminal tab at the bottom of the window open. It will display information concerning the upload of the code. Once the code uploads, the device will reboot, and you should see the following output: The device was rebooted to start the application. Your "Hello world" code is now running. Although the "Hello World" example is now running, we cannot yet see the text. 5.4. See console output If using STDIO UART make sure you have wired it up first. STDIO USB does not need any wiring other than being

connected to your computer. In VS Code. Go to the view menu, and select "Terminal" to open the bottom pane. In this pane, you will find the "Serial Monitor" tab. Select the serial port. There may be more than one. The baud rate should be 115200. Select "Start Monitoring" to see the output. Figure 6. VS Code serial monitor Getting started with Raspberry Pi Pico-series 5.4. See console output 14 Appendix A: Debugprobe Raspberry Pi provides two ways to debug Pico-series devices: • the Raspberry Pi Debug Probe

• debugprobe firmware running on a second Pico or Pico 2 Both methods provide a way to debug Pico-series devices on platforms that lack GPIOs to connect directly to UART or SWD, such as Windows, macOS, and Linux. The debugging device connects to your usual computer using USB, and to the Pico using SWD and UART. Building OpenOCD Shortly after RP2350 launch you will likely need to build openocd from source if not using the VS Code extension. You can get a binary release from https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk-tools.

$ git clone https://github.com/raspberrypi/openocd.git $ cd openocd $ ./bootstrap $ ./configure --disable-werror $ make -j4 To start openocd from the build directory, you can use: For RP2350: sudo src/openocd -s tcl -f interface/cmsis-dap.cfg -f target/rp2350.cfg -c "adapter speed 5000" For RP2040: sudo src/openocd -s tcl -f interface/cmsis-dap.cfg -f target/rp2040.cfg -c "adapter speed 5000" Install OpenOCD To get started, you’ll need OpenOCD. To install OpenOCD, run the following command in a terminal:

$ sudo apt install openocd To install OpenOCD on macOS, run the following command: $ brew install openocd Getting started with Raspberry Pi Pico-series Building OpenOCD 15 To run OpenOCD, use the openocd command in your terminal. Debug Probe The simplest way to debug a Pico-series device is the Raspberry Pi Debug Probe. The Raspberry Pi Debug Probe provides Serial Wire Debug (SWD), and a generic USB-to-Serial bridge. NOTE For more information about the Debug Probe, see the documentation site. Debug Probe wiring

Figure 7. Wires included with the Debug Probe. Getting started with Raspberry Pi Pico-series Debug Probe 16 Figure 8. Wiring between the Debug Probe (left) and Pico (right). To connect Debug Probe to Pico H, connect the following: • Debug Probe "D" port to Pico H "DEBUG" SWD JST-SH connector • Debug Probe "U" port, with the three-pin JST-SH connector to 0.1-inch header (male): ◦Debug Probe RX connected to Pico H TX pin ◦Debug Probe TX connected to Pico H RX pin ◦Debug Probe GND connected to Pico H GND pin

Then, connect two USB cables: one from your computer to the microUSB port on Debug Probe and another from your computer to the microUSB port on Pico. NOTE If you have a non-H Pico, Pico 2 or Pico W (without a JST-SH connector) you can still connect it to a Debug Probe. Solder a male connector to the SWCLK, GND, and SWDIO header pins on the board. Using the alternate 3-pin JST-SH connector to 0.1-inch header (female) cable included with the Debug Probe, connect to the Debug Probe "D" port. Connect SWCLK, GND, and SWDIO on the Pico or Pico W to the SC, GND, and SD pins on the Debug Probe, respectively.

The wiring loom between Pico and the Debug Probe is shown in Figure 8. Debug with a second Pico or Pico 2 One Pico or Pico 2 can reprogram and debug another using the debugprobe firmware, which transforms the Pico or Pico 2 into a USB → SWD and UART bridge. Getting started with Raspberry Pi Pico-series Debug with a second Pico or Pico 2 17 Figure 9. Wiring between Pico A (left) and Pico B (right) with Pico A acting as a debugger and Pico B as a system under test. You must connect at least the ground and the two

SWD wires. Connect the UART serial port to provide access to the UART serial output of Pico B. You can also bridge the power supply to power both boards with one USB cable. For more information, see debugprobe wiring. Install debugprobe You can download a UF2 binary of debugprobe from the Pico-series documentation. Boot the debugger Pico or Pico 2 with the BOOTSEL button pressed. Copy debugprobe_on_pico.uf2 onto the device to begin debugging. NOTE Use debugprobe_on_pico.uf2 to use a Pico for debugging. Use debugprobe.uf2 for the Debug Probe accessory hardware.

Build debugprobe Alternatively, you can build debugprobe using the following instructions: These build instructions assume you are running on Linux, and have installed the SDK. NOTE These instructions are for Pico; replace the -DPICO_BOARD=pico with -DPICO_BOARD=pico2 for Pico 2 $ cd ~/pico $ git clone https://github.com/raspberrypi/debugprobe.git $ cd debugprobe $ git submodule update --init $ mkdir build $ cd build $ export PICO_SDK_PATH=../../pico-sdk $ cmake -DDEBUG_ON_PICO=ON -DPICO_BOARD=pico ..

$ make -j4 Boot the debugger Pico or Pico 2 with the BOOTSEL button pressed. Copy debugprobe.uf2 onto the device to begin debugging. debugprobe wiring Getting started with Raspberry Pi Pico-series debugprobe wiring 18 Figure 10. Wiring between Pico A (left) and Pico B (right), configuring Pico A as a debugger. The wiring loom between the two Pico boards is shown in Figure 10. Pico A GND -> Pico B GND Pico A GP2 -> Pico B SWCLK Pico A GP3 -> Pico B SWDIO Pico A GP4/UART1 TX -> Pico B GP1/UART0 RX

Pico A GP5/UART1 RX -> Pico B GP0/UART0 TX The minimum set of connections required to load and run code via OpenOCD is GND, SWCLK and SWDIO. Connect the UART wires to communicate with Pico B’s UART serial port through Pico A’s USB connection. You can also use the UART wires to talk to any other UART serial device, such as the boot console on a Raspberry Pi. To power Pico A with Pico B, connect the following pins: • When using USB in device mode, or not at all, connect VSYS to VSYS • When acting as a USB Host, connect VBUS to VBUS to provide 5V on the USB connector.

Debug Probe interfaces Both the Debug Probe and any Pico-serires device running debugprobe are composite devices with two USB interfaces: 1. A class-compliant CDC UART (serial port), so it works on Windows out of the box. 2. A vendor-specific interface for SWD probe data conforming to CMSIS-DAP v2. Use the UART Linux To use the UART connection on Linux, run the following command: Getting started with Raspberry Pi Pico-series Debug Probe interfaces 19 $ sudo minicom -D /dev/ttyACM0 -b 115200 Windows

Download and install PuTTY. Open Device Manager and locate the COM port number of the device running debugprobe. In this example it is COM7. Open PuTTY. Select Serial under connection type. Then type the name of your COM port along with 115200 as the speed. Getting started with Raspberry Pi Pico-series Use the UART 20 Select Open to start the serial console. You are now ready to run your application. macOS First, install minicom using Homebrew: $ brew install minicom Then, run the following command to use the UART connection:

Getting started with Raspberry Pi Pico-series Use the UART 21 $ minicom -D /dev/tty.usbmodem1234561 -b 115200 Debug with OpenOCD With Debug Probe, you can load binaries via the SWD port and OpenOCD. First, build a binary. Then, run the following command to upload the binary to the Pico, replacing blink.elf with the name of the ELF file you just built: $ sudo openocd -f interface/cmsis-dap.cfg -f target/rp2040.cfg -c "adapter speed 5000" -c "program blink.elf verify reset exit" If you are using a RP2350 based board, then use

$ sudo openocd -f interface/cmsis-dap.cfg -f target/rp2350.cfg -c "adapter speed 5000" -c "program blink.elf verify reset exit" Debug with SWD You can also use openocd in server mode and connect a debugger that provides break points and more. IMPORTANT To allow debugging, build your binaries with the Debug build type using the DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE option: $ cd ~/pico/pico-examples/ $ rm -rf build $ mkdir build $ cd build $ export PICO_SDK_PATH=../../pico-sdk $ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DPICO_BOARD=pico ..

$ cd blink $ make -j4 Note: you should use -DPICO_BOARD=pico2 for a Raspberry Pi Pico 2. The debug build provides more information when you run it under the debugger. First, run an OpenOCD server: $ sudo openocd -f interface/cmsis-dap.cfg -f target/rp2040.cfg -c "adapter speed 5000" For a RP2350-based device use -f target/rp2350.cfg instead. Then, open a second terminal window. Start your debugger, passing your binary as an argument: Getting started with Raspberry Pi Pico-series Debug with OpenOCD

22 $ gdb blink.elf > target remote localhost:3333 > monitor reset init > continue GDB doesn’t work on all platforms. Use one of the following alternatives instead of gdb, depending on your operating system and device: • On Linux devices that are not Raspberry Pis, use gdb-multiarch. • On Arm-based macOS devices, use lldb. Getting started with Raspberry Pi Pico-series Debug with OpenOCD 23 Appendix B: Picotool It is possible to embed information into a Pico-series binary, which can be retrieved using a command line utility called

picotool. Getting picotool The picotool utility is available in its own repository. You will need to clone and build it if you haven’t ran the pico-setup script. $ git clone https://github.com/raspberrypi/picotool.git $ cd picotool You will also need to install libusb if it is not already installed, $ sudo apt install libusb-1.0-0-dev NOTE If you are building picotool on macOS you can install libusb using Homebrew, $ brew install libusb pkg-config While if you are building on Microsoft Windows you can download and install a Windows binary of libusb directly

from the libusb.info site. Building picotool Building picotool can be done as follows, $ mkdir build $ cd build $ export PICO_SDK_PATH=~/pico/pico-sdk $ cmake ../ $ make this will generate a picotool command-line binary in the build/picotool directory. Getting started with Raspberry Pi Pico-series Getting picotool 24 NOTE If you are building on Microsoft Windows you should invoke CMake as follows, C:\Users\pico\picotool> mkdir build C:\Users\pico\picotool> cd build C:\Users\pico\picotool\build> cmake .. -G "NMake Makefiles"

indicating that there was a Pico-series device connected then you can run picotool using sudo, e.g. $ sudo picotool info -a If you get this message on Windows you will need to install a driver. Download and run Zadig, select RP2 Boot (Interface 1) from the dropdown box and select WinUSB as the driver, and click on the "Install Driver" button. Wait for the installation to complete - this may take a few minutes. As of version 1.1 of picotool it is also possible to interact with Raspberry Pi microcontrollers that are not in BOOTSEL

mode, but are using USB stdio support from the SDK by using the -f argument of picotool. Display information So there is now Binary Information support in the SDK which allows for easily storing compact information that picotool can find (See Binary Information below). The info command is for reading this information. The information can be either read from one or more connected Raspberry Pi microcontrollers in BOOTSEL mode, or from a file. This file can be an ELF, a UF2 or a BIN file. $ picotool help info

30 Appendix C: Manual toolchain setup Configure your environment via Script If you are developing for a Pico-series device on the Raspberry Pi 5, the Raspberry Pi 4B, or the Raspberry Pi 400, most of the installation steps in this Getting Started guide can be skipped by running the pico_setup.sh script. The script automates the following setup: • Creates a directory called pico in the folder where you run the pico_setup.sh script • Installs required dependencies • Downloads the pico-sdk, pico-examples, pico-extras, and pico-playground repositories

• Defines PICO_SDK_PATH, PICO_EXAMPLES_PATH, PICO_EXTRAS_PATH, and PICO_PLAYGROUND_PATH in your ~/.bashrc • Builds the blink and hello_world examples in pico-examples/build/blink and pico-examples/build/hello_world • Downloads and builds picotool (see Appendix B), and copy it to /usr/local/bin. • Downloads and builds debugprobe (see Appendix A). • Downloads and compiles OpenOCD (for debug support) • Configures your development Raspberry Pi UART for use with Pico-series devices  TIP This setup script requires approximately 2.5GB of disk space on your SD card, so make sure you have enough free

space before running it. You can check how much free disk space you have with the df -h command. First, run the following command to install wget: $ sudo apt install wget You can get this script by running the following command in a terminal: $ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raspberrypi/pico-setup/master/pico_setup.sh ① Then mark the script as executable with chmod: $ chmod +x pico_setup.sh Run the script with the following command: $ ./pico_setup.sh Finally, reboot your Raspberry Pi to load your UART configuration changes:

Getting started with Raspberry Pi Pico-series Configure your environment via Script 31 $ sudo reboot Manually Configure your Environment Get the SDK and examples The Pico Examples repository provides a set of example applications written using the SDK. To clone these repositories, create a pico directory where you can store pico-related files. The following commands create a subdirectory named pico in your home directory: $ mkdir ~/pico Then, clone the pico-sdk and pico-examples git repositories:

$ cd ~/pico $ git clone https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk.git --branch master $ cd pico-sdk $ git submodule update --init $ cd .. $ git clone https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-examples.git --branch master Install the Toolchain To build the applications in pico-examples, you’ll need to install some extra tools. To build projects you’ll need CMake, a cross-platform tool used to build the software, and the ARM GNU Toolchain. Run the following command to install these dependencies: $ sudo apt update

$ sudo apt install cmake gcc-arm-none-eabi libnewlib-arm-none-eabi build-essential Ubuntu and Debian users might additionally need to do: apt install g++ libstdc++-arm-none-eabi-newlib Enable UART serial communications To enable UART serial communications on your development device. To do so on a Raspberry Pi running Raspberry Pi OS, run raspi-config: $ sudo raspi-config Getting started with Raspberry Pi Pico-series Manually Configure your Environment 32 1. Navigate to Interfacing Options > Serial.

2. When asked "Would you like a login shell to be accessible over serial?", answer "No". 3. When asked "Would you like the serial port hardware to be enabled?", answer "Yes". You should see something like Figure 11: Figure 11. Enabling a serial UART using raspi-config on the Raspberry Pi. Exit raspi-config with Esc. Choose "Yes" and reboot your Raspberry Pi to enable the serial port. IMPORTANT Raspberry Pi 5 makes the UART on the 3-pin debug header the default for serial0. To use use GPIO pins 15 and 14

instead, append dtparam=uart0_console to /boot/firmware/config.txt. Update the SDK When a new version of the SDK is released, you must update your copy of the SDK. To update, navigate into pico-sdk and run the following command: $ cd pico-sdk $ git pull $ git submodule update NOTE To be informed of new releases, set up a custom watch on the pico-sdk GitHub repository. Navigate to https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk and select Watch → Custom → Releases. You will receive an email notification when a new SDK release occurs.

Use the CLI to Blink an LED in C When you’re writing software for hardware, turning an LED on, off, and then on again, is typically the first program that gets run in a new programming environment. Learning how to blink an LED gets you half way to anywhere. So let’s blink the LED on a Pico-series device. Getting started with Raspberry Pi Pico-series Use the CLI to Blink an LED in C 33 The following example blinks the LED connected to pin 25 of a Raspberry Pi Pico or Pico 2: Pico Examples: https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-examples/blob/master/blink_simple/blink_simple.c Lines 31 - 39

31 int main() { 32     pico_led_init(); 33     while (true) { 34         pico_set_led(true); 35         sleep_ms(LED_DELAY_MS); 36         pico_set_led(false); 37         sleep_ms(LED_DELAY_MS); 38     } 39 } The actual code for the "blink" example is slightly complicated as it also supports blinking the LED connected to the Infineon 43439 wireless chip on the Pico W. The full code can be found here sdkexampleref::blink/blink.c Building "Blink" From the pico directory we created earlier, navigate into pico-examples and create a build directory:

$ cd pico-examples $ mkdir build $ cd build Then, set the PICO_SDK_PATH, assuming you cloned the pico-sdk and pico-examples repositories into the same directory: $ export PICO_SDK_PATH=../../pico-sdk  TIP Throughout this book we use the relative path ../../pico-sdk to the SDK repository for PICO_SDK_PATH. Depending on the location of your repository, you could replace this with an absolute path. Build "Blink" Prepare your cmake build directory by running the following command: $ cmake .. Using PICO_SDK_PATH from environment ('../../pico-sdk')

PICO_SDK_PATH is /home/pi/pico/pico-sdk . . . -- Build files have been written to: /home/pi/pico/pico-examples/build Getting started with Raspberry Pi Pico-series Use the CLI to Blink an LED in C 34 IMPORTANT The SDK builds binaries for the Raspberry Pi Pico by default. To build a binary for a different board, pass the -DPICO_BOARD=<board> option to CMake, replacing the <board> placeholder with the name of the board you’d like to target. To build a binary for Pico 2, pass -DPICO_BOARD=pico2. To build a binary for Pico W, pass -DPICO_BOARD=pico_w.

You can specify a Wi-Fi network and password that your Pico W examples should connect to, by passing -DWIFI_SSID="Your Network" -DWIFI_PASSWORD="Your Password" too. You can now type make to build all example applications. However, for this example we only need to build blink. To build a specific subtree of examples, navigate into the corresponding subtree before running make. In this case, we can build only the blink task by first navigating into the blink directory, then running make: $ cd blink

$ make -j4 Scanning dependencies of target ELF2UF2Build Scanning dependencies of target boot_stage2_original [  0%] Creating directories for 'ELF2UF2Build' . . . [100%] Linking CXX executable blink.elf [100%] Built target blink  TIP Invoking make with -j4 speeds the build up by running four jobs in parallel. A Raspberry Pi 5 has four cores, so four jobs spreads the build evenly across the entire SoC. Amongst other targets, this builds: blink.elf used by the debugger blink.uf2 the file we’ll copy onto the USB Mass Storage Device that represents your Raspberry Pi microcontroller

Load and run "Blink" To load software onto a Raspberry Pi microcontroller-based board, mount it as a USB Mass Storage Device and copy a uf2 file onto the board to program the flash. Hold down the BOOTSEL button (Figure 12) while plugging in your device using a micro-USB cable to force it into USB Mass Storage Mode. The device will reboot, unmount itself as a Mass Storage Device, and run the flashed code, see Figure 12. Getting started with Raspberry Pi Pico-series Use the CLI to Blink an LED in C

35 Figure 12. Blinking the on-board LED on the Raspberry Pi Pico. Arrows point to the on- board LED, and the BOOTSEL button. Using the command line  TIP You can use picotool to load a UF2 binary onto your Pico-series device, see Appendix B. Depending on the platform you use to compile binaries, you may have to mount the mass storage device manually: $ dmesg | tail [  371.973555] sd 0:0:0:0: [sda] Attached SCSI removable disk $ sudo mkdir -p /mnt/pico $ sudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/pico If you can see files in /mnt/pico, the USB Mass Storage Device has mounted correctly:

$ ls /mnt/pico/ INDEX.HTM  INFO_UF2.TXT Copy your blink.uf2 onto the device: $ sudo cp blink.uf2 /mnt/pico $ sudo sync The microcontroller automatically disconnects as a USB Mass Storage Device and runs your code, but just to be safe, you should unmount manually as well: $ sudo umount /mnt/pico Getting started with Raspberry Pi Pico-series Use the CLI to Blink an LED in C 36 NOTE Removing power from the board does not remove the code. When you restore power to the board, the flashed code will run again.

Aside: Other Boards If you are not following these instructions on a Raspberry Pi Pico-series device, you may not have a BOOTSEL button (as labelled in Figure 12). Your board may have some other way of loading code, which the board supplier should have documented: • Most boards expose the SWD interface ([debug_probe_section]) which can reset the board and load code without any button presses • There may be some other way of pulling down the flash CS pin (which is how the BOOTSEL button works on Pico-

series devices), such as shorting together a pair of jumper pins • Some boards have a reset button, but no BOOTSEL; they might detect a double-press of the reset button to enter the bootloader In all cases you should consult the documentation for the specific board you are using, which should describe the best way to load firmware onto that board.

.uf2 The program code and data in a UF2 form that you can drag-and-drop on to the device when it is mounted as a USB drive .dis A disassembly of the compiled binary .hex Hexdump of the compiled binary .map A map file to accompany the .elf file describing where the linker has arranged segments in memory NOTE UF2 (USB Flashing Format) is a Microsoft-developed file format used for flashing Raspberry Pi microcontrollers over USB. For more information, see the Microsoft UF2 Specification Repo. NOTE

To build a binary to run in SRAM, rather than Flash memory you can either setup your cmake build with -DPICO_NO_FLASH=1 or you can add pico_set_binary_type(TARGET_NAME no_flash) to control it on a per binary basis in your CMakeLists.txt file. You can download the RAM binary to Raspberry Pi microcontrollers via UF2. For example, if there is no flash chip on your board, you can download a binary that runs on the on-chip RAM using UF2 as it simply specifies the addresses of where data goes. Note you can only download in to RAM or FLASH, not both.

Debugging your project Debugging your own project from the command line follows the same processes as we used for the "Hello World" example back in Debug with SWD. Need more detail? There should be enough here to show you how to get started, but you may find yourself wondering why some of these files and incantations are needed. The Raspberry Pi Pico-series C/C++ SDK book dives Getting started with Raspberry Pi Pico-series Manually Create your own Project 39 deeper into how your project is actually built, and how the lines in our CMakeLists.txt files here relate to

the structure of the SDK, if you find yourself wanting to know more at some future point. Getting started with Raspberry Pi Pico-series Manually Create your own Project 40 Appendix D: Use other Integrated Development Environments The recommended Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is Visual Studio Code. However other environments can be used with Raspberry Pi microcontrollers and Raspberry Pi Pico-series. Use Eclipse Eclipse is a multiplatform Integrated Development environment (IDE) available for Linux, macOS, and Windows. The

latest version works well on the Raspberry Pi 4, 400, and 5 (4GB and up) running a 64-bit OS. The following instructions describe how to set up Eclipse on a Linux device for to develop on Pico-series devices. Instructions for other systems will be broadly similar, although the details of connecting to Pico-series devices vary. Setting up Eclipse for Pico on a Linux machine Prerequisites: • Device running a recent version of Linux with at least 4GB of RAM • 64-bit operating system. • CMake 3.11 or newer

If using a Raspberry Pi, you should enable the standard UART by adding the following to config.txt enable_uart=1 You should also install OpenOCD and the SWD debug system. See [debug_probe_section] for instructions on how to do this. Installing Eclipse and Eclipse plugins Install the latest version of Eclipse IDE for Embedded C/C++ Developers using the standard instructions. If you are running on an ARM platform, you will need to install an AArch64 (64-bit ARM) version of Eclipse. All versions can be

found on the Eclipse website. https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages Download the correct file for your system, and extract it. You can then run it by going to the place where it was extracted and running the 'eclipse' executable. $ ./eclipse The Embedded CDT version of Eclipse includes the C/C++ development kit and the Embedded development kit, so has everything you need to develop for Pico-series devices. Using pico-examples The standard build system for the Pico environment is CMake. However Eclipse does not use CMake as it has its own

build system, so we need to convert the pico-examples CMake build to an Eclipse project. Getting started with Raspberry Pi Pico-series Use Eclipse 41 1. At the same level as the pico-examples folder, create a new folder, for example pico-examples-eclipse 2. Change directory to that folder 3. Set the path to the PICO_SDK_PATH $ export PICO_SDK_PATH=<wherever> 4. Run the following command: $ cmake -G"Eclipse CDT4 - Unix Makefiles" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ../pico-examples IMPORTANT The SDK builds binaries for the Raspberry Pi Pico by default. To build a binary for a different board, pass the

-DPICO_BOARD=<board> option to CMake, replacing the <board> placeholder with the name of the board you’d like to target. To build a binary for Pico 2, pass -DPICO_BOARD=pico2. To build a binary for Pico W, pass -DPICO_BOARD=pico_w. To specify a Wi-Fi network and password that your Pico W should connect to, pass -DWIFI_SSID="Your Network" -DWIFI_PASSWORD="Your Password". This will create the Eclipse project files in our pico-examples-eclipse folder, using the source from the original CMake tree. You can now load your new project files into Eclipse using the Open project From File System option in the File menu.

Building Right click on the project in the project explorer, and select Build. This will build all the examples. OpenOCD This example uses the OpenOCD system to communicate with a Raspberry Pi microcontroller. You will need to have provided the 2-wire debug connections from the host device to the microcontroller prior to running the code. On a Raspberry Pi, this can be done via GPIO connections, but on a laptop or desktop device, you need to use extra hardware for this connection. One way is to use the Debug Probe.

Once OpenOCD is installed and the correct connection made, Eclipse needs to be set up to talk to OpenOCD when programs are run. OpenOCD provides a GDB interface to Eclipse, and it is that interface that is used when debugging. To set up the OpenOCD system, select Preferences from the Window menu. Click on MCU arrow to expand the options and click on Global OpenOCD path. For the executable, type in “openocd”. For the folder, select the location in the file system where you have cloned the Pico OpenOCD fork from github.

Getting started with Raspberry Pi Pico-series Use Eclipse 42 Figure 13. Setting the OCD executable name and path in Eclipse. Creating a Run configuration In order to run or debug code in Eclipse you need to set up a Run Configuration. This sets up all the information needed to identify the code to run, any parameters, the debugger, source paths and SVD information. From the Eclipse Run menu, select Run Configurations. To create a debugger configuration, select GDB OpenOCD Debugging option, then select the New Configuration button.

Figure 14. Creating a new Run/Debug configuration in Eclipse. Setting up the application to run Because the pico-examples build creates lots of different application executables, you need to select which specific one is to be run or debugged. On the Main tab of the Run configuration page, use the Browse option to select the C/C++ applications you wish to run. The Eclipse build will have created the executables in sub folders of the Eclipse project folder. In our example case this is …/pico-examples-eclipse/<name of example folder>/<optional name of example subfolder>/executable.elf

So for example, if we running the LED blink example, this can be found at: Getting started with Raspberry Pi Pico-series Use Eclipse 43 …/pico-examples-eclipse/blink/blink.elf Figure 15. Setting the executable to debug in Eclipse. Setting up the debugger Let’s set up OpenOCD to talk to the Raspberry Pi microcontroller. Set openocd in the boxes labelled Executable and Actual Executable. We also need to set up OpenOCD to use the Pico specific configuration, so in the Config options sections add the following. You will need to change the path to point to

the location where the Pico version of OpenOCD is installed. -f interface/raspberrypi-swd.cfg -f target/rp2040.cfg Replace rp2040.cfg with rp2350.cfg if you are using a RP2350-based device. All other OpenOCD settings should be set to the default values. The actual debugger used is GDB. This talks to the OpenOCD debugger for the actual communications with the Raspberry Pi microcontroller, but provides a standard interface to the IDE. The particular version of GDB used is gdb-multiarch, so enter this in the fields labelled Executable Name and Actual

Executable. Getting started with Raspberry Pi Pico-series Use Eclipse 44 Figure 16. Setting up the Debugger and OpenOCD in Eclipse. Setting up the SVD plugin SVD provides a mechanism to view and set peripheral registers on the Pico board. An SVD file provides register locations and descriptions, and the SVD plugin for Eclipse integrates that functionality in to the Eclipse IDE. The SVD plugin comes as part of the Embedded development plugins. Select the SVD path tab on the Launch configuration, and enter the location on the file system where the SVD file is

located. This is usually found in the pico-sdk source tree. E.g. …/pico-sdk/src/rp2040/hardware_regs/RP2040.svd or …/pico-sdk/src/rp2350/hardware_regs/RP2350.svd Figure 17. Setting the SVD path in Eclipse. Getting started with Raspberry Pi Pico-series Use Eclipse 45 Running the Debugger Once the Run configuration is complete and saved, you can launch immediately using the Run button at the bottom right of the dialog, or simply Apply the changes and Close the dialog. You can then run the application using the Run Menu Debug

option. This will set Eclipse in to debug perspective, which will display a multitude of different debug and source code windows, along with the very useful Peripherals view which uses the SVD data to provide access to peripheral registers. From this point on this is a standard Eclipse debugging session. Figure 18. The Eclipse debugger running, showing some of the debugging window available. Use CLion CLion is a multiplatform Integrated Development environment (IDE) from JetBrains, available for Linux, Windows and

Mac. This is a commercial IDE often the choice of professional developers (or those who love JetBrains IDEs) although there are free or reduce price licenses available. It will run on a Raspberry Pi, however the performance is not ideal, so it is expected you would be using CLion on your desktop or laptop. Whilst setting up projects, development and building are a breeze, setting up debug is still not very mainstream at the moment, so be warned. Setting up CLion If you are planning to use CLion we assume you either have it installed or can install it from https://www.jetbrains.com/

clion/ Setting up a project Here we are using pico-examples as the example project. To open the pico-examples project, select Open… from the File menu, and then navigate to and select the pico-examples directory you checked out, and press OK. Once open you’ll see something like Figure 19. Getting started with Raspberry Pi Pico-series Use CLion 46 Figure 19. A newly opened CLion pico- examples project. Notice at the bottom that CLion attempted to load the CMake project, but there was an error; namely that we hadn’t

specified PICO_SDK_PATH Configuring CMake Profiles Select Settings… from the File menu, and then navigate to and select 'CMake' under Build, Execution, Deployment. You can set the environment variable PICO_SDK_PATH under Environment: as in Figure 20, or you can set it as -DPICO_SDK_PATH=xxx under CMake options:. These are just like the environment variables or command line args when calling cmake from the command line, so this is where you’d specify CMake settings such as PICO_BOARD, PICO_TOOLCHAIN_PATH etc.

Figure 20. Configuring a CMake profile in CLion. Getting started with Raspberry Pi Pico-series Use CLion 47 IMPORTANT The SDK builds binaries for the Raspberry Pi Pico by default. To build a binary for a different board, pass the -DPICO_BOARD=<board> option to CMake, replacing the <board> placeholder with the name of the board you’d like to target. To build a binary for Pico 2, pass -DPICO_BOARD=pico2. To build a binary for Pico W, pass -DPICO_BOARD=pico_w. To specify a Wi-Fi network and password that your Pico W should connect to, pass -DWIFI_SSID="Your Network"

-DWIFI_PASSWORD="Your Password". You can have as many CMake profiles as you like with different settings. You probably want to add a Release build by hitting the + button, and then filling in the PICO_SDK_PATH again, or by hitting the copy button two to the right, and fixing the name and settings (see Figure 21) Figure 21. Configuring a second CMake Profile in CLion. After pressing OK, you’ll see something like Figure 22. Note that there are two tabs for the two profiles (Debug and Release) at the bottom of the window. In this case Release is selected, and you can see that the CMake setup was

successful. Figure 22. Configuring a second CMake profile in CLion. Running a build Now we can choose to build one or more targets. For example you can navigate to the drop down selector in the middle of the toolbar, and select or starting typing hello_usb; then press the tool icon to its left to build (see Figure 23). Getting started with Raspberry Pi Pico-series Use CLion 48 Alternatively you can do a full build of all targets or other types of build from the Build menu. Figure 23. hello_usb successfully built.

Note that the drop down selector lets you choose both the target you want to build and a CMake profile to use (in this case one of Debug or Release) Another thing you’ll notice Figure 23 shows is that in the bottom status bar, you can see hello_usb and Debug again. These are showing you the target and CMake profile being used to control syntax highlighting etc. in the editor (This was auto selected when you chose hello_usb before). You can visually see in the stdio.c file that has been opened by the

user, that PICO_STDIO_USB is set, but PICO_STDIO_UART is not (which are part of the configuration of hello_usb). Build time per binary configuration of libraries is heavily used within the SDK, so this is a very nice feature. Build Artifacts The build artifacts are located under cmake-build-<profile> under the project root (see Figure 24). In this case this is the cmake-build-debug directory. The UF2 file can be copied onto a Raspberry Pi microcontroller in BOOTSEL mode, or the ELF can be used for

debugging. Figure 24. Locating the hello_usb build artifacts Getting started with Raspberry Pi Pico-series Use CLion 49 Other Environments There are too development environments available to describe all of them here. You can use many of them with the SDK. In general, IDEs require the following features to support Pico-series devices: • CMake integration • GDB support with remote options • SVD. Not essential but makes reading peripheral status much easier • Optional Arm embedded development plugin. These types of plugin often make support much easier.

2020 GUIDE TO 3D PRINTING MATERIALS PAGE 2 2020 GUIDE TO 3D PRINTING MATERIALS a.	 Model Materials b.	 Support Materials TABLE OF CONTENTS P 5. P 19. P 17. INTRODUCTION TO 3D PRINTING MATERIALS 3D PRINTING MATERIALS: FROM CONCEPT TO PRODUCTION WITH BASE POLYMERS NOT ALL 3D PRINTERS ARE EQUAL: 5 Things that allow MakerBot METHOD to Print Materials Better COMPOSITES: THE NEXT GENERATION OF 3D PRINTING MATERIALS P  4. PAGE 3 2020 GUIDE TO 3D PRINTING MATERIALS INTRODUCTION TO 3D PRINTING MATERIALS In 1989, the first FDM (Fused Deposition Modeling) 3D printer was invented and, with it, the dawn of an era

of possibilities for product design and manufacturing. The first material for that printer was a mix of wax and plastic. Over the next 30 years, material scientists developed a range of new and exotic materials, while hardware and software advancements in 3D printing enabled the use of these new materials. Most of the early 3D printers and materials developed were only available to companies who could afford their six-figure (or more) price tags, but recently there has been a renaissance in which major material

manufacturers are flocking to the space. With that popularity, a wealth of new materials are being developed and optimized for 3D printers. While some of these materials print spectacularly, others still have a ways to go in terms of reliability, print quality, or material performance. Some materials are extremely affordable and others can be costly. With all of these options and variables, it can be daunting to someone who is relatively new to 3D printing. For that reason, we’ve created a guide that will take you through the ins and outs of FDM 3D printing materials,

when to use them, and what to expect along the way. PAGE 4 2020 GUIDE TO 3D PRINTING MATERIALS PLA TOUGH PET-G NYLON ABS ASA PC-ABS PC-ABS FR Nylon Carbon Fiber Conceptual Prototyping Functional Prototyping Manufacturing Aids End-Use  Parts Explaining the properties and pros and cons of materials is helpful, but it might not be clear which material is right for your application(s). In this section, we’ll take some base FDM polymers and organize them in the context of the product development cycle – with the first materials being best for the initial concepts, and the

last more suited for the manufacturing line or final end-use parts. 3D Printing Materials: From Concept to Production with Base Polymers PAGE 5 2020 GUIDE TO 3D PRINTING MATERIALS PLA Fast, Easy, Rigid Best Uses: Concept prototypes PLA (polylactic acid) is a great material for early concept models because it is easy to use, office-friendly, and works well with breakaway supports which print faster and can be removed faster than dissolvable supports. PLA is a corn-based plastic and is considered biodegradable under industrial processes. PLA is

strong in tensile strength and modulus relative to other base polymers, which may be surprising to some because it is generally viewed as a fairly basic material. One potential downside of PLA is its brittleness – if it fails, it fractures catastrophically whereas some of the other polymers may bend. Parts: 3D Laser Scanner Support: Breakaway Support Print Time: 23h 58m These 3D laser scanner prototypes are printed using PLA with breakaway supports and showcase how multiple iterations can be printed quickly and

cost-effectively to help with concept development. Model Materials PAGE 6 2020 GUIDE TO 3D PRINTING MATERIALS Best Uses: Functional prototypes Tough is a relatively new category of material that has a PLA base with modifiers to increase its tensile modulus to make it more impact-resistant. The combination of ease of use, office-friendliness, and durability / machinability make it great for mid-stage prototypes. Tough has an incredibly high elongation before break making it highly durable – this can be seen when printing extremely thin living hinges, which can be bent back

and flexed many times before breaking. While highly durable, Tough can lack the higher quality surface and detail finish of both PLA and ABS. TOUGH MATERIAL Fast, Easy, Durable Parts: Mouse Support: PVA Print Time: 26h 31m This computer mouse assembly prototype is printed using MakerBot Tough Material with PVA dissolvable supports. The PVA support washes away with water allowing for more complex geometries without harming the surface finish. PAGE 7 2020 GUIDE TO 3D PRINTING MATERIALS Best Uses: Functional prototypes

PETG’s (glycol-modified polyethylene terephthalate) chemical resistance makes it a choice material for liquid containers and bottles, which also makes it great for prototyping those types of products. While available in a range of colors, PETG’s glycol addition removes haziness to give it a nice translucence. The glycol also increases the strength and heat-resistance compared to PET. In addition to containers, the liquid / chemical resistance can benefit a range of uses from the machine shop to the lab.

PETG Chemical Resistant, Durable Parts: CNC Shop Vac Vaccum Nozzle Support: PVA Print Time: 6h 41m This vacuum nozzle was printed as an attachment for a shop vac for removing waste material from a CNC machine. PETG is a great choice for this application due to the material’s chemical resistance to the CNC coolant. PAGE 8 2020 GUIDE TO 3D PRINTING MATERIALS Best Uses: Functional prototypes, manufacturing tools ABS (acrylonitrile butadiene styrene) is one of the most popular materials for injection molded consumer

products due to its clean surface finish, durability, and heat resistance. For this reason, it is often used for prototyping consumer products that will later be injection molded. By using ABS, the prototype is more likely to look, feel, and perform like the final product. ABS’s durability and high heat deflection temperature also makes it a good material for use in the lab or on the factory floor. ABS Smooth, Durable, Heat-Resistant Parts: Thermocouple Thermometer Support: Stratasys® SR-30 Print Time: 16h 16m

This meat thermometer from OXO is a great example of a complex assembly being prototyped in the same material as the final injection molded part – ABS. PAGE 9 2020 GUIDE TO 3D PRINTING MATERIALS Best Uses: Functional prototypes ASA (acrylonitrile styrene acrylate) combines the qualities of ABS with the added benefit of UV resistance and additional moisture resistance, making it ideal for equipment exposed to sunlight and rain over long periods of time – such as products for the agriculture, transportation, and power and utility industries.

Because the use of ASA is fairly common in production parts for these industries, the prototyping of the same parts in ASA allows test engineers to better understand how their products will hold up in extreme weather conditions. In the field, a utility worker or a farmer could benefit from printing replacement parts as needed for broken equipment. ASA UV and Weather Resistant, Durable Parts: Electrical Outlet Cover Support: Stratasys® SR-30 Print Time: 4h 29m This electrical outlet cover is printed in ASA and is a

great example of a prototype for testing products that will be exposed to outdoor elements. PAGE 10 2020 GUIDE TO 3D PRINTING MATERIALS Best Uses: Replacement Parts Nylon’s ability to withstand high temperatures and its durability combine to give it above average abrasion resistance. While the storage of replacement parts can be costly, the ability to instead store the CAD file and print the parts as needed is an alternative that can save space and provide flexibility. Gears take consistent punishment and high abrasion, making Nylon an ideal material for this type of part.

NYLON Abrasion-Resistant, Strong This conveyor gear is an example of a replacement part for a manufacturing facility or distribution center. Parts: Conveyor Gear Support: PVA Print Time: 10h 19m PAGE 11 2020 GUIDE TO 3D PRINTING MATERIALS Best Uses: Functional Prototypes, End-Use Part PC-ABS might seem like a composite, being that it is a mix of two polymers (polycarbonate and ABS), but the classic definition of a composite for 3D printing materials tends to refer to a polymer that has been reinforced

with a solid particle (fibers, glass beads, etc.).  If you use ABS, you might want to check out PC-ABS. It’s got many of the properties that make ABS desirable with added strength and heat-resistance beyond the range of regular ABS and thus is a common material used in the automotive industry. PC-ABS Durable and Heat Resistant This Train Car Handle represents an ergonomic prototype utilizing the same PC-ABS material that will be used in the final stage of production Parts: Train Car Handle Support: SR-30

Print Time: 14h 01m PAGE 12 2020 GUIDE TO 3D PRINTING MATERIALS Best Uses: End-Use Parts Preventing or slowing the spread of fire can be important in many testing or end-use applications. By modifying a base polymer like PC-ABS,, it is possible to 3D print parts that are not only strong, but also have extinguishing properties that prevent flames. FR is an important characteristic for parts made for the automotive, railway, and aerospace industries. PC-ABS FR Durable, Heat Resistant, and Flame Retardant

This air-quality nozzle is printed in PC-ABS FR and due to its physical characteristics and FR make it ideal for end-use in  a train or bus. Parts: A/C Outlet Support: SR-30 Print Time: 8h 46m PAGE 13 2020 GUIDE TO 3D PRINTING MATERIALS Breakaway supports aren’t so much a type of material, but rather a software trick in which the slicing program fills in the void below the model with a removable structure printed in the same material. Breakaway supports are popular because they can use the same material as the printed model with a single extruder (as opposed

to dissolvable supports requiring a second extruder and material). The quality of the print then depends on a couple of variables. The first is dependent on the slicing algorithm. A good slicer will ensure that the prints are well supported, but also leave a seam along which a clean break can be made. The second thing to consider is which material is being used. A hard, rigid plastic like PLA is really best for this because it is more apt to having a clean fracture whereas a less rigid plastic will bend and tear when removing support, leaving

remnants on the model part. Whether you’re working with FDM, SLA, SLS, or another type of 3D printer, unless you’re printing in space, you have to account for gravity. If you’re printing something like a solid cube, this isn’t really an issue because each layer has a corresponding layer beneath it for support. But what if you have an object that has portions of the model that are essentially floating in midair with no structure directly underneath them? This is where removable supports come into play. Depending on the type of FDM 3D printer you are working with, there are

a few good options you can use. BREAKAWAY (USING MODEL MATERIAL) Support Materials Enabling the most complex geometries PAGE 14 2020 GUIDE TO 3D PRINTING MATERIALS PVA (polyvinyl alcohol) is a water soluble support material that is compatible with many lower temperature model materials such as PLA and PETG. Printing PVA alongside a model material requires at least two extruders so you’ll need a printer with dual extrusion for this. Because PVA is water soluble, it is extremely office-friendly - you can place your part in water and after a few hours, the supports will

dissolve. Using a dissolvable material like PVA allows you to create much more complex parts because the solvent (in this case water) can reach deep within channels and crevices of the part. It also can reduce the damage caused to the print, which might be more prevalent when using breakaway supports. PVA Parts: Ski Goggles Model: Tough Print Time: 25h 48m This single cylinder engine block is printed in MakerBot Tough with PVA water-soluble supports. The PVA supports in this example showcase the ability to print

deep channels without compromising the dimensional accuracy or surface finish of the part itself. Putting the part in water overnight will yield a clean part that is ready to bolt into place for a fit test in this case. PAGE 15 2020 GUIDE TO 3D PRINTING MATERIALS SR-30 is a proprietary material developed by Stratasys to work seamlessly with ABS, ASA, and various other high-temp materials. Because of this focused development, using SR-30 with these typically more challenging materials can yield exceptional results that wouldn’t be possible with something like PVA,

which is very difficult to use with ABS. Like PVA, SR-30 is dissolvable and can enable extreme complexity of geometry while maintaining excellent surface finish at the support site. Unlike PVA, SR-30 requires a specialty solvent along with heat, to efficiently dissolve. Users of SR-30 will need to invest in additional equipment, and possibly use in a more controlled environment like a lab. SR-30 Parts: EOA Robotic Sander Model: ABS Print Time: 66h 15m This robotic sander is an end of arm tool that can

be attached to a Universal Robots UR10e arm for automated hand sanding. The part benefits from the use of Stratasys® SR-30 dissolvable support, which allows for the design of an internal cavity in which sawdust can be channeled from the surface to a shop vac hose fitted to the exhaust vent. PAGE 16 2020 GUIDE TO 3D PRINTING MATERIALS While it’s important to have a firm core of base polymers for your printer, there is growing excitement around composite materials, or materials that combine a polymer with a solid particle (fiber, bead, etc)  to enhance

properties and increase performance. The MakerBot LABS Experimental Extruder for METHOD, for example, gives users the possibility of using MakerBot’s primary base polymers, alongside a massive array of third- party composites and other advanced polymers. While it’s not realistic to cover each and every composite, there are a few examples below that give insight into a world of new possibilities through these offerings. CARBON FIBER + BASE POLYMER Parts: 3 Blade Propeller Model: SR-30 Print Time: 13h 34m

This 3 Blade Propeller benefits from high tensile strength with its ability to withstand very high RPMs while maintaining a low-weight profile. COMPOSITES: THE NEXT GENERATION OF 3D PRINTING MATERIALS PAGE 17 2020 GUIDE TO 3D PRINTING MATERIALS Carbon Fiber is one of those materials that creates a buzz whenever it comes up, and for good reason. The use of carbon fibers can create incredible strength while keeping weight low. Carbon fibers can be composited with a number of other polymers, for example ABS carbon fiber can provide the clean surface

of ABS with the added strength of carbon fibers. Nylon 6 Carbon Fiber has the strength and lightweight benefits of other carbon fiber composites. The main thing about Nylon 6 that sets it apart from others in that category is its ability to withstand higher temperatures. The heat deflection temperature is significantly higher than many of the popular base polymers. In the case of MakerBot Nylon Carbon Fiber, the HDT is 100°C higher than that of ABS and 93°C higher than regular Nylon 6. This propeller printed in Nylon 6 Carbon Fiber has the tensile strength to spin at high RPMs while maintaining

a lightweight profile and withstanding temperatures of up to 184°C. Much like Nylon 6 Carbon Fiber, the Nylon 12 variant has the benefits of strength, stiffness, and lightweight. Unlike Nylon 6, Nylon 12 has a better resistance to moisture uptake, making it somewhat easier to print and giving the printed part a cleaner final appearance without the need for post-processing. One drawback of Nylon 12 compared to Nylon 6 is it will generally have a lower HDT - so you really just need to weight what is

most important for your specific application. ESD (Electrostatic Dissipative) is a property that reduces static electricity in order to protect electrostatic-sensitive devices, or to contain flammable liquids or gases. Through modifications in chemistry, and the addition of a solid particle such as Carbon Black, 3D printing base polymers, such as PETG, can take on ESD characteristics, making them ideal for creating test fixtures or housings for circuit boards. ESD NYLON 6 CARBON FIBER NYLON 12 CARBON FIBER

Parts: Electronics Board Jig Model: SR-30 Print Time: 4h 32m PAGE 18 2020 GUIDE TO 3D PRINTING MATERIALS While FDM (also known as FFF) is a specific category of 3D printers, that doesn’t mean all FDM 3D printers are created equally. Within the family of FDM, costs can range from $200 to $200,000. While the most basic 3D printing technology is a build plate, with an extruder and a gantry, there are many things you can do to improve print quality, material diversity, complexity, and more. For this section, we’re going to focus

on the industrial processes and features that enable the MakerBot METHOD to print with a unique blend of speed, dimensional accuracy, and reliability. We’ll go in chronological order from initial development through to final print. DUAL PERFORMANCE DRY-SEALED CIRCULATING HEATED TOUCHSCREEN ULTRA-RIGID METAL FRAME SENSORS + CONNECTIVITY SPRING STEEL BUILD PLATE SMART SPOOLS AND SMART ASSIST MATERIAL LOADER DISSOLUBLE  SUPPORT SYSTEM Not All 3D Printers are Equal: 5 Things that allow MakerBot METHOD

to Print Materials Better PAGE 19 2020 GUIDE TO 3D PRINTING MATERIALS 1. Testing and Optimization Once the decision is made to optimize a new material for the METHOD platform, MakerBot typically works with a material supplier to get samples and suggested settings. From there, a collaborative effort between MakerBot’s software development team and test engineering group will develop and optimize slicing profiles that will yield best results in part quality, surface finish, dimensional accuracy, and print time. Depending on

the material type, this process can take up to several months. During the optimization, ABR tests are conducted across dozens of printers to ensure consistency of these settings while printing some of the most challenging geometries. These tests can be grueling and push the printers to their limits to find the limits of both the hardware and the material, and ensure the user will have a good experience when they print with the new material. PRINTER OPTIMIZATION TORTURE TESTING PAGE 20 2020 GUIDE TO 3D PRINTING MATERIALS

2. Shipping and Handling Once the material is manufactured, it is spooled up and bagged. METHOD utilizes the Smart Spool system, which is a purpose-built spool that contains sensors read by the printer when loaded into the material bay. The RFID chips contain information about the material type, color, amount remaining on the spool, etc. This information allows the printer to use the optimized print settings with the material type, further streamlining the user experience. The spools are shipped in resealable mylar bags, which are impermeable to light and

moisture and help protect the filament from potential damage. Within the spool there is also desiccant to keep the environment moisture-free. SMART SPOOL / MYLAR BAG PAGE 21 2020 GUIDE TO 3D PRINTING MATERIALS 3. Loading and Storing Once the spool is loaded into the drawer of the material bay, you only need to insert the tip of the filament into the material slot. The printer recognizes the presence of filament and will do the rest of the work loading the filament up the routing tube and into the

extruder. This hands-free process is not only convenient for users but also prevents the user from accidentally adjusting a calibrated extruder. Once material starts loading, the drawers on the material bays can be closed. The two Dry-Sealed Material Bays are sealed from the outside environment. This seal, combined with the desiccant cartridge of the Smart Spool, ensures that the material is stored in a low-humidity environment even during printing and in between prints. A sensor in the bay can show the humidity

level within the bay and humidity levels can be tracked across Smart Spools. Protection from humidity is especially important when printing with materials like Nylon and PVA – both of which are prone to absorb moisture which can cause damage to the end print. SMART ASSIST MATERIAL LOADER DRY-SEALED MATERIAL BAYS PAGE 22 2020 GUIDE TO 3D PRINTING MATERIALS 4. Printing METHOD has two extruders – one for model material and one for support material. These extruders are packed with a sensor suite and chip set that enable them to accurately

control print temperature so as not to damage materials. The sensor suite also includes active jam detection, and auto- stop when filament runs out. With a range of temperatures, METHOD’s extruders can handle higher temp materials such as ABS and ASA, or when active cooling is turned on, single extrusion low temp materials can be printed with ease. PERFORMANCE EXTRUDERS One of the marquee features of METHOD that distinguishes it from other 3D printer options in its price class is the Circulating

Heated Build Chamber. Using two active heat exchangers on either side of the printer, METHOD warms the chamber temperature from 40°C and 100°C depending on the material. By creating a consistent chamber temperature throughout, METHOD is able to achieve a printed part dimensional accuracy within ±0.007in (±0.2mm) of the CAD design. The added heat also increases the strength of the bond between vertical layer lines – giving the part strength on all three axes (not just two). CIRCULATING HEATED CHAMBER

PAGE 23 2020 GUIDE TO 3D PRINTING MATERIALS 5. Drying A new feature added to METHOD is the ability to dry spools using the heat within the Circulating Heated Chamber. This is great if you have a spool that’s been left out of the bag for a long period of time, or if the spool is older and the desiccant has become saturated. To run this function, use the touchscreen to navigate to Settings > Advanced and select Dry Filament. CHAMBER MATERIAL DRYING Print all the materials in this guide and more on METHOD
